1,One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.,3.0

12,"The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.

13,"This product is cute and is pretty comfy for sleeping.  However, the pants are made for a WNBA center: minimum height of 6'6"".  I'm 5'6"" and the bottom of the pants hit well past the end of my toes.  I guess I'll have to hem them, but there's a cute trim at the bottom of the legs that I'll lose once I do that.  I haven't washed them yet, so maybe they'll shrink a bit, but I doubt it will take a foot off the length.",3.0

15,"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th",2.0

17,"Does not look like the picture. I will give them credit for the product arriving considerably earlier than promised. Not sure how to describe what it looked like, but it was much puffier than the picture and the nubby material was very sticky - for lack of a better word. Everything stuck to it. Only had it on for a few moments and pretty sure that every dog hair and piece of fuzz on the plant was stuck to it! Returned!",1.0

22,"Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs, however, i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall, it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.",3.0

33,"I'm 5'7”, 175 pounds, and was unsure of my size due to recent weight loss.I ordered a 12 and a 14, assuming one of the two would be a good fit. Nope.The 12s came up higher on my waist than the 14s, which was strange but I liked the height. They felt comfortable but were snug all over and the material is too thin to wear snug, they looked painted on.The 14s, strangely, were a lower cut than the 12s. Shorter and wider because the legs and hips fit well... The thin fabric looked nice that loose but the waist band was wide and asking for a belt and the legs had so much extra fabric that they bunched up when I walked.Trying to choose which I would wear in public was frustrating and in the end I decided to return both.Still giving a few stars because odd fit aside the fabric was stretchy and comfortable, the stitching seemed good quality, and the style is cute. Nice for those who fit the cut.",3.0

39,"I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large, or something? ! i ordered an xs, my usual size, xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose, the upper arms are a bit snug, and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place, but when you look at the model, it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received, and another reviewer, the seam was puffy, making for a strange look. in theory, the shirt should have worked, but didn't. i loved the pattern, not the fit.",2.0

75,Jacket is well made. Fabric is stretchy.  Fabric shrinks alot! Fabric had a bad odor after washing in warm water using Gain detergent then  removing from dryer...bad odor.  So bad I had to spray essential oils on it so I could wear it.  Update:  I tried to wear this jacket sprayed with perfume.  It still has a bad odor.  So I washed it again in Clorox bleach. I put good scented dryer sheets in dryer.  When I opened the dryer it smelled bad (like human or animal poop).  Not as strong but still to stinky to wear.  I should be given a full refund.

That being said, I think they are Levi’s cheaper line that they make for their outlet and places like Target. I have been to the Levi’s outlet and their wedgies fit like these ones, so I think they are authentic. They have way more stretch to them, way less “denim.” Wedgies fromNordstrom are much more stiff and less stretch, which is what I like since they have less spandex and more denim. That said, I think these are authentic, but lower line Levi’s, which makes sense given the cheaper price. This price is the same as the outlet price. So my recommendation: if you have never had wedgies, you may like these. If you have wedgies from a department store and love them, you won’t like the fit of these at all. I returned mine.",3.0

High rise all the way only because I get a muffin waist with anything else. These eliminated that for me completely. No more tight belts or having to constantly pull the waist of my jeans up.

They are extremly comfortable.I live in Arizona so during the summer I wear the ones that have at least one rip in the legs which is like air conditioning for my legs. It is nice to grab a pair of jeans from my closet and always be putting on my favorite go-to jeans. I wash them inside out (unless I got something on them) and dry on medium and remove them from dryer before they are super hot.I wonder if I can buy stock in these because I believe these are the best jeans out there.

Back then, I used the Amazon recommendation to determine my size selection. (It was based on purchases of size 4 32"" inseam Wrangler jeans and Baleaf highwaisted size S 32"" length yoga pants and Prana size 2 reg Halle hiking pants among other orders.) In other words, I bought what I ""knew"" was one size too big, because I wanted exactly that ""full"" fit.

Once they're on, the lack of room in the crotch means that the seam in the back continually tries to insert itself between my cheeks.

The overall length and arm length are both what they should be, but the body of the jacket is ridiculously baggy. I mean hilariously baggy. I could almost fit two of my torso in the jacket and still button it comfortably. If this is built for heavy-set people, they should note that in the description. It's insanely baggy with no form of any kind. It's a parachute with sleeves. If I jumped out of an airplane in this thing, I could probably glide to safety like one of those flying squirrels. I tried washing it to shrink it a bit, but all that did was significantly fade the color, and one of the sleeve buttons fell off.

They are warm enough for temperate weather, but not too warm, comfortable, soft, and loose enough not to be restrictive but not so loose as to become a baggy nuisance.  If you are looking for a casual sweater to wear over a t-shirt, I highly recommend them.  (If you have fabric sensitivities, give one a try.  I found them quite comfortable.  I did not notice them against my skin as much as I do poly blends, and I found them to breathe well and to not make me uncomfortably sweaty the way poly blends do.)The one shortcoming they may have is that they do not do all that well in the dryer.  To get around this, I let them lie flat until they are nearly dry and then just run them in the dryer for 15-20 minutes at low heat to get the last of the moisture out of them.

Despite these pictures making the suit look pretty nice… It was way way too big for me. I ordered a size small and I definitely should’ve ordered an extra small. I was on the low end of the measurements for the small size but the discrepancy is huge. In these pictures I have completely rebuilt the entire suit with safety pins in order for it to fit like this, I took in almost 3 inches from the vest, 2 inches from the jacket and about 4 inches from the pants. Considering that this suit is coming from an Asian country I assumed it would be a smaller fit but still followed the size chart. It is quite the opposite. It is an incredibly “American” fit. It was a huge inconvenience because it took two weeks for shipping and I had a show to do. I did not have time to send the suit back and wait to get the correct size.Now I’ve worn it and put safety pins in it so I don’t think I can return it… So I’m stuck with this giant suit. If you’re using it for a costume it’s pretty OK quality. The material is a bit sheer but as you can see in the photos, it photographs well.

The drawstring in the pyjama bottom is synthetic which slips and opens the knot - my pajamas almost dropped in front of my 20 year old sister in law.Since I had the order shipped to me overseas it cost me additional $58.52 for shipping and import duties ie almost $99 for a Nautica sleepwear.

pros:

- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.
- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.

I ordered a size 7 and though they seemed slightly tighter, was still uncomfortably loose within an hour or so of wearing them.I recently received the size 5 that I ordered but they were noticeably loose, pulling on without even having to unbutton them. This prompted me to compare the sizes.As you can tell in the pictures, the size 7 is much smaller than the size 5. I even borrowed my friend's size 5 to compare a washed and new pair. I thought, maybe they shrink after wash, but that doesn't seem like the case here.Side note: After speaking to my friend who owns the same shorts, she is experiencing the same issues with the sizes. She has sized down 3 times and considering trying the next size down. It almost seems impossible to get the right fit here. Something, possibly the stretch of the waist seem, is very off. I feel like I need those waist adjusters found in children's clothes here.So what you should know is that:1) these shorts are very stretchy2) you should definitely size down3) the color will fade just a bit after wash4) and just because you order a specific size, it's highly possible that they won't fit like that size should.Even though I've struggled in finding a good fit with these shorts, I'll still give them 4 stars because everything else about them is great.

First, the photo showed an image of a Navy jacket with khaki pants, light blue, shirt and pink tie. What was delivered was a navy jacket, grey pants, blue shirt, and navy/gold striped tie. Like I said, it's a cute outfit. It just wasn't what was described. Secondly, while the jacket seems quite nice, the pants seem very low quality. The material is super thin. Lastly the tag on the shirt is really irritating, and one of those stiff plastic feeling tags that even when you cut it out of the shirt, the remnants still remain.I'm giving this review three out of five stars because the product as a whole is still a good deal for the price. I just wish it came as described. Ultimately, I ended up buying an additional tie so my son and daughter would match colors. So maybe the price wasn't such a good deal after all.Anyway, if you're not picky... Go for it! If you want something specific, get it somewhere else.",3.0

The chart is accurate as far as my actual measurements but there is no room for other garments underneath without stretching to close the button. I have not decided if I would return and get a 4x. I may keep it. I am worried the shoulders might look too sloppy if I size up. Planning to order another in 4x before returning the 3x to compare. If 4x fits better around the waist without material pulling and is looser at shoulders needs shoulder pads I can add them.  May order other colors depending upon subsequent fit of the 4x.  I think this product is fine if you want a semi tailored look. I wanted something light for packing and traveling so this works for me. It's more of a light sweater than suit blazer.  The ruched sleeves are nice for a more contemporary look.  Since I am not using this in a formal office setting the sleeves are perfect. I did not wash it yet so I can not comment on wrinkles.

They fit, but they are tight.  I'm kind of disappointed.  I remember being a teen and had a pair of Lees, size 5 and they ran tight back then.  In hindsight I should have ordered a size up, like a 16 but I think I'll just start walking instead! lol.  If I knew what I know now though, I would have ordered a 16 and I would have been happier.  I'll make good with these, and like I said I'll start exercising more.  I am not going to return these though because they do still fit, they're just a bit tight.  I need to wear a top that is flattering.Another thing I don't like about these jeans is that they are high rise.  My mid section is not model like and having the curves that I have makes the high rise sort of uncomfortable while sitting down.  As soon as they were delivered I tried them on and that's when I knew I should have ordered size 16.  However my husband had a good idea and advised me to leave them on for the night (before I put my pjs on).  I must say that was a good idea because I can tell that they have relaxed a bit.

It's ridiculous. With how much they cut corners for quality, you'd think that would afford them to ability to produce some of these pants in more sizes that accommodate thin people, or cut the price down to what these things are actually worth.

I just needed some cheap tee shirts, and something on the thinner side wouldn't hurt either.These are the thin, lightweight material I was hoping for, and still quite soft. The one I tried on straight from the package fit me nicely, though it was a little longer than I'd like. I expect they'll shrink in the wash, which would be ok as the fit was just slightly loose.However, there was a hole in the front of the shirt! I didn't look at the other 4 from the package, I just packed them up for exchange. Hopefully the second go 'round yields better results. I'll update/add to my review as necessary.UPDATED REVIEW (3 1/2 STARS): The replacement pack of shirts arrived and none of them have holes! They shrunk in the wash a bit, but still fit well enough.

And I got a size 28 (:*I did originally order a 27 and it was wearable but not at all breathable, 28 was perfect.Pros: The quality is great. They’re a true vintage high rise fit. They are loose enough to breathe and be comfortable which is perfect since there’s no stretchiness in them at all. They are great coverage,  so even if you bend over your butt cheeks won’t show.Cons: So while they fit perfect around the waist and hips, the cut off at your legs is horrendous lol. In the last picture, the piece I’m holding was attached with strings that went over my thigh but it was so bad and even tighter than the actual shorts so I had to cut them out. The third and forth picture show what I mean, sitting down you will have biscuit can bulging thighs, period. Lol and they roll up when sitting down so it can get really uncomfortable quick…and as you can see the space on my waist and belly area even when I’m sitting so it’s not that the shorts are overall too small. When standing they aren’t tight around my thighs at all though. Also, in the third pic when I’m sitting, that poof that looks like my belly is actually space just more space in the shorts. Lol. The last two cons I have aren’t really cons that just are weird little things about the shorts that bug me but not enough to actually call them cons. So first one is the crinkle on the butt in the center area. I dont have a huge booty but I have a booty, if that makes sense, so it’s just a weird thing they do I guess. If you have a bigger butt you may not have that issue idk. The second thing is there’s 5 buttons. Which isn’t an issue expect the lowest one is LOW lol and it can be a booger to get them in the loops as some of the loops are not that big.So to sum it up, they’re great shorts for anything that doesn’t involve a lot of sitting.",4.0

7853,"I’m 5’6” and 145 lbs (bottom heavy). I’m always between sizes. Sometimes between medium and small. Sometimes between medium and large. Since this is a tent dress, it was between medium and small. The dress on the left is the medium and the dress on the right is the small. The biggest differences are the length and the top. I hate my knees. I can’t explain it. I don’t pretend that that’s a normal feeling, but here we are. I have avoided shorts and dresses shorter than midi length for most of my life. BUT I live in south Louisiana and it’s just too hot for all that nonsense, and I’m older and wiser now. So you can see the difference in length. I think in real life it’s only an inch, but to me that’s the difference between being comfortable and not being comfortable. The second thing that you probably can’t see is the top part is a little tighter. Although I probably would have liked how the top fit better, the length won the toss up. If you actually have anything bigger than an A cup keep the top in mind. I am a 34A (so is my 11 year old), so I don’t usually have to worry about tops being “too tight”. The mid section doesn’t touch me at all so I like that part because I don’t have to hold anything in or wear a torture device. This color is nice and the material is so soft. I’ll probably wear a slip because it’s a little sheer and being an educator I cannot take that chance because too many teenagers have phones. I wouldn’t give it a 5 because unless you are a toothpick I wouldn’t use “flattering” to describe it, but it’s a keeper because it’s easy and comfortable and the price is nice.",4.0

It pairs up with just about anything depending on the color you choose - over a collared shirt to go to church or over a t-shirt when grocery shopping at the big box when you need to go into their walk-in freezers. Also useful as a light extra layer for fall evenings. The mesh liner keeps you feeling cool if things warm up a bit and keeps air flowing. There are two buttons on the sleeves that make wrist adjustments easy. Big bonus to me are a set of zippered side pockets that sit behind the standard normal unzippered side pockets. They look just alike a normal set of pockets but provide extra storage that can be secured. All pockets lay nice and flat. There’s also two inside pockets one each at chest level for glasses and such, AND there’s an additional small inside pocket with hook and loop closure below the inside left pocket.

The two lower pockets are faux pockets.  There is one pocket in the inside.  It also has shoulder pads that give a more stately appearance.Overall the jacket fits nice and looks good on.

I said no because everyone in my house would be asleep. That was the end of my conversations with Amazon.  So my take on Try Before You Buy? FORGET ABOUT IT!

I've bought several in different colors over the last year and as yet, have not had one come apart on me though I feel a few have shrunk.  I really like that they don't thread a plastic tag through the product and instead opt for a clip akin to a safety pin. There are several tags attached to this pin, they do not contain washing instructions despite having plenty of places to print that information. Printed on the inside of the shirt there are what appear to be washing symbols. I've had several young people try to explain these symbols to me but their expressive interpretive dances have failed to successfully communicate the proper instructions. On the upside, they seem to like to touch the shirt and while doing so they give way to soft cooing and purring noises that soon have fingers pulling and tugging to remove all clothing. Though I've had no complaints personally, I would very much like these shirts to be thicker and I would pay more for a thicker version. In the meantime, I've emailed the archeological department of the local university in hopes of bringing these symbols to an egyptologist who caught my fancy when I stumbled into their lecture by accident. My hope is that their knowledge of ancient hieroglyphics can shed some light on the symbols of my shirt and I would be interested to know if these shirts are as soft as Egyptian cotton.

Between them squeezing my thighs, flattening my butt, and being too loose around the waist — I’ll unfortunately be returning. Super cute, just not for my body type!",2.0
9956,"The fabric and drape of this blazer is beautiful. I bought the black in Large and the pink in XL, and both give the perfect oversized look. If you are wanting the same look as the model, order the XL. Once the blazer is ironed, it looks and feels way more expensive than it is. I plan to buy more colors!",5.0
9957,"When I saw this blouse on the site I fell in love with it. However, when I received it it did not fit, it was not true to size, the color and all was great but I had to return it and I don't like returning things, it was to small I did not want to get a bigger size so I just used the credit to purchase something else. I ordered it a 2x all my shirts are 2x but this one was to small so if you're planning on buying this blouse order it a little bigger than your regular size.",2.0
9958,"I suspected that the product quality may be an issue based on the price, but I took a chance.  It appears cheap (fabric, hang on the body, etc.).  Skip it and pay the money for a better blazer.",1.0
9959,"Bought these for my husband about a month ago, they ripped down the whole back-- this is so surprising from Wrangler Jeans because the others he has have lasted forever!  I dont know if these are not authentic or something but such a bummer, will not be ordering from here again for them!",1.0
9960,What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.,3.0
9961,This tee is very fitted.  Not comfortable. Even my husband tried it and it was riégate in the chest and abs area.,1.0

9963,"I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.",5.0
9964,"Great pants, great construction. The only thing to note is that the material is quite thick and it makes the pants a bit warmer than expected.",4.0
9965,"I liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store. the price is right considering what some jeans cost today. unfortunately, these are made in china. that bummed me out. they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist. the higher waist is a nice change. it's nice to be able to skip a belt. the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up.",4.0
9966,"Pretty color, great stretch. Great color. A little soft but just feels like cheap very low quality polyester fabric. Blech and I’m no diva.  Happier with bamboo pajamas from Amazon.",2.0
9967,I just received this in the green color. it is a true medium jade green. my monitor shows a blue color and that is what i expected. the green is pretty but i would have preferred the blue that was shown. i found this to fit large . the pockets that are barely visible in any of the photos gape open and don't lie flat. i do like this sweater as a very casual jacket alternative on cooler days. the cashmere is a nice weight and is not too precious to wear every day with jeans.,4.0

9969,The product was great…. The delivery was awful! My friend is on oxygen and very limited. The pkg was left at the mailbox …not at his door! He had to struggle to get it! Always before the items are delivered to his door.,5.0
9970,I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,5.0

9972,I returned this jacket. It was too big in all the wrong places but the sleeves were ridiculously short. I’m 5’9 and weigh around 135. The sleeves were too baggy and short and the coat itself was big,1.0
9973,This jacket is a neutral color with a subtle print that adds great character. the stitching around the edges is cute. the shape is very flattering and not too boxy as some open jackets can be. a perfect layering piece!,5.0

9975,"I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.",2.0

9978,"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",1.0
9979,"I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....",2.0

9981,"So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small, didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine, has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(",3.0
9982,Very cute and good quality. It was just a hair shorter than I wanted so I wear shorts underneath,4.0
9983,"I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.",2.0
9984,"be wary on sizing. i thought an xl would fit because i usually fit xl in stretchy pants/shorts. while the xl DOES fit my body, it has a slight rolling problem on the thighs and tummy. size up if you’ve got bigger thighs and a tummy! i assume that an xxl will fit me 100% perfectly! otherwise, products came as listed, good, breathable material!",3.0

9989,"This is such a clean and cute printed dress and i knew that i had to try the dress when i first saw it online. after reading other reviews, i sized up. i am normally a 0 or 2 in retailer. i ordered the 2 and it fits nicely and looks great. however, i feel like the 2 buttons at the lowered rib cage area gape slightly. the tie covers it and holds it in place, unless i sit, then it gapes freely. i am a 32 a so not big chested at all, and yet this fit snug in the chest area. i would worry about",4.0
