Sent back. Poor quality.,1.0
"I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. 


fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. 

i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t",1.0

Fits very loosely sweater has no shape.,1.0
I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.,1.0
"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",1.0

"I loved what this shirt looked like online.  Used the sizing chart to order the shirt that would fit my bust size.  It took a while for it to arrive and when I went to try it on, I couldn't even get it on.  I was very disappointed.",1.0
"It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however, i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.",1.0
"Very disappointed in these jeans as they are NOT true to size at all, way to small.",1.0
"As I sit here in a very baggy 3xtall t shirt typing this, I can tell you the sizing is laughable. I ordered 3 of these by the way so it's not like it was a mislabeled item. I ordered 4xtall so I could have a very baggy outside shirt. I had to re read the tag after trying to put this on. I have 2xtall shirts that fit better. This was worse than spandex. I took this off and put on a 2x shirt I have which was snug and wearable but no where near this.  These aren't long (if you order tall) and the 4 xtall actually fit my 6 foot tall 185 lb son like a slightly loose shirt.Like I said, if it was just one I'd assume it was a bad one but thats not the case.",1.0
May not be authentic Levi’s. I have several from actual Levi’s outlet stores and those hold up pretty well! No shrinkage at all. Buyer beware!!,1.0
Ordered larger than size and still did not fit. Would not recommend.,1.0
You get what you pay for and I thought I paid enough. Material not like  picture or as advertised. Shrunk even after following washing instructions.,1.0

"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1'', 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite. 

first of all, when i button this, there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow, yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all, making the gaping even worse.

the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap, thin, slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled, and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl",1.0
Within 30 minutes of wear around the house noticed multiple holes in the fabric. Very lightweight.,1.0
"This is like paint on the chest. It’s so unbelievably tight you can’t lift your arms up. For reference I’m 5’5 120 so i ordered my regular size a small and it was so tight I have to return, I also really don’t like the elastic waist line it looks so cheap in person",1.0

"This dress fit nicely, but armholes were a little too big,  I did not have time to return this item, we were going on vacation,  so I wore a cami underneath.  After washing it,and NOT drying it in dryer,  it shrunk quite a bit and the armholes were worse, out of shape and too gaping, where if worn with a cami underneath it looked very unattractive.  I would not purchase this type item again.",1.0
"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.",1.0
"I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. 

such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.",1.0
"This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri",1.0

"I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.",1.0

I had intended to wear it. I am oddly without said sweater. The carriers are not reliable. Don't think I will be ordering in the future. Had to give something I have never laid eyes on a review. Don't even know what it feels like.,1.0
This was a very different material than I expected. I was hoping for more of a business type material I could wear for work. Instead it was like a workout material/jacket. Did not work for what I needed. Had to return.,1.0

Pockets too far back. It is not true to size; tight through shoulders/back. returning it.,1.0

Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.,1.0

This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.,1.0

They are nice jeans but when I stretch or bend my knees they rip into a bigger hole . This is just my experience with them,1.0

I expected it to be a little on the small side. According to the size chart it would have been a 2 inch difference but this was like an 8 inch difference.  It so frustrating to buy online I never go by size always the chart to check inches but this one LIES!!!,1.0

This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.,1.0
The snap and belt broke; other than that the pants are great.,1.0
The jeans are awesome looking but I can't wear them because they were improperly sown. The butt seem needs let out to fit around the waist. I've never experienced anything like this before so it's hard to explain. I'm stuck with pants I can't wear.,1.0

I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.,1.0

"Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l",1.0

Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!,1.0
"There was not one thing I liked about these PJ’s, just horrible.",1.0
I was expecting this shirt to be what was in the photo. IT IS NOT! The fabric is not the cute linen like shown. It is polyester and not light weight. It is a boxy rigid shirt that isn't true to size. BEWARE the shirt is nothing like what is pictured. Returned for a refund,1.0

"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy, thin, and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back, it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.",1.0
When I first received this shirt I tried it on and it fit just fine. So I washed it like I always do when I get new clothes. I washed it in cold water and tumble dried on low. Well I just put it on and it shrunk. It now fits like a small. So it is true to size until you wash it. I suggest buying a size bigger because of this. I am now stuck with a shirt that I can't wear and now I have to repurchase it in the next size up.,1.0
I wear an extra large and it is cut very small. The print looks cute in the photos but when I got it in the mail it is very ugly returning it,1.0

Poor fit.  Meant for short people with a very large waist.  Poor quality too and not soft cotton.,1.0

"Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.",1.0

Disappointed. Bought a couple of pair of these shorts for my teen’s gym class. They are super light weight material to a fault. They are really see through and unwearable!

Want to show off your abs but still look casual?  This is your shirt.  Don't be dismayed when you receive it and it extends past your belt line like a regular polo.  Just toss it in the washer like you would any other piece of clothing and this will shrink up just how you want it.,1.0

A good pair of jeans if they would last. So far every pair I have owned of them has had an issue with the belt loops. I think it might be a stitching issue as the belt loop tears at the stitching leaving you with a belt loop that won't hold a belt. You could have it redone and be fine but considering that I've had multiple pairs in less the six months with the same issue something it just wrong with the jeans themselves.,1.0

I have this dress in black (XL) and it’s a perpetual favorite for the past 2 years. The fabric gives perfectly without stretching out. The only alteration was a taper from bottom hip to hem since I’m curvy and the dress dropped kinda straight. The green pales in comparison.

Of all the Lee Extreme Comfort Fit pants we’ve purchased, this has never been an issue.",1.0

It's dry clean only, so I wasn't going to put it in the washer, but I did soak the spot in cold water. 5 minutes later I take out the top and it's got a HUGE black line across it! I checked to make sure I hadn't set it on something that would stain it--nope, just from sitting in some cold water. I dabbed the new spot with a tiny bit of stain remover and soaked the top in cold water again in the hopes that I could salvage it. As you can see from the picture the top was completely destroyed. I can't imagine what would have happened if I had gotten caught in the rain unexpectedly during my interview. I don't expect to be able to put a top like this into a washing machine, but I DO expect to be able to soak a spot in some cold water without completely wrecking it. Really disappointed.",1.0

Not what I expected. I am sending it back and getting the one I want at a local store I thought I could save a little money ordering on here instead of going to the local boutique in town. It’s not a blazer it’s a sweater and it’s not long in the front like it is in the picture nor is it fitting to you,1.0
Held the shirt up to show husband.  I could see through both layers.Key Lime.,1.0
"I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.",1.0
"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",1.0
"This sweater shrinks a lot! And, does not fit right because the back of the sweater comes too high up on the neck. Could not return it because I washed it.",1.0
"This suit is true to size if you’ve never seen a gym in your life. My suit size is 44 due to my shoulder and arm length, pant size being 36. I ordered a 44 showing the pant size being 38 because I assumed it’s be a little small. I got the suit and tried it on for the pants to not make it past my quads. Super disappointed.",1.0
"These pajamas made me overheat, and I am not prone to overheating. So uncomfortable!",1.0
"I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online, i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.",1.0
Fabric is too thin.,1.0
Shein strikes again. I should’ve known better. The color is bright and bold just as advertised. The accuracy ends there. I’m a size 18. This would fit a size…8. Maybe. And yes I measured. The material has little stretch and is pure polyester. The kind that makes you smell like a gym sock after wearing it for 20 minutes. Not a cute look.,1.0
"I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.",1.0
Unfortunately the deal didn't work out right for me. I had to return it. Bad quality product.,1.0
"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",1.0
"The shirt is thin and feels extremely cheap, but good for summer wear. It does feel a size to big.",1.0
It's poor design! Don't buy this ito item! manufactured poor very loose waiste. looks more big than it post to be the small size,1.0
This skirt has no closure along the slit. i can't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed. it completely baffled me,1.0
I booth these for the gym and they are not squat proof. You can straight out see your underwear.,1.0
"The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up, a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.",1.0
Cute dress but way tooSheer…it’s see through,1.0
"After one wash the seam in one arm completely came apart. And that was on dictate as well as inside of a fabric bag. The neck of it is also too tight and choking, and the one size does not fit someone with a little larger belly. It rides up. Would not recommend this just for the poor quality in which it was made alone.",1.0

I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.,1.0
I’m a normal large or xl. Got this in xl and it is more like a small. Barely fit over my head. Material is itchy polyester too. Going back. Thank goodness for Amazon returns.,1.0

Shirt fit great on the top. The only issue was it was way too short in the length. It was a pretty short just too short so I’m returning.,1.0
I returned this item. Way too much stretch. Not real heavy duty Levi's jeans. Can't wear these jeans for my job.,1.0
My son wore these to one practice and there is already a huge hole from sliding. Do not recommend.,1.0

Tight arms in comparison to the jacket,1.0
"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes",1.0
"I was very excited to receive these shorts…However, as soon as I opened the package I knew they were going to be way too small. Size medium fits more like an xs. Sizing description is inaccurate. Size up!!",1.0

Very very small. Like three sizes. Returning. Probably chinese.,1.0
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,1.0
I loved both pair and couldn't wait to wear them buy the so called CAPRI length pants were more for a tall . very disappointed. inseam was in the mid 30s,1.0

I usually wear xs but this time the item way too small,1.0
I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don't know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it.,1.0

"I LOVED this jacket. After less than a month of using, the zipper is gone, teeth are missing from the zipper itself and I can't wear it anymore. This jacket is a total waste of money.",1.0
These are WAY WAY WAY smaller than what they say.  I wear 18 and these wear more like 12's I couldn't come close to buttoning them.  I read other reviews and they claimed that the pants were big but that was not the case for me.  Returning,1.0
Pants ripped first time I wore them. Will NOT be buying from this company again.,1.0

This top is made of extremely poor quality of fabric. I don’t recommend it. Should cost couple dollars. Way overpriced and cheap looking,1.0
"So the images are misleading or I’m color blind, I ordered olive pants but got dark grey instead? The material and feel is not like a dress pants at all but more like dickie work pants. I previously owned a pair that I felt faded away too quickly so I decided to order another one to see if it might be different but something tells me it’s gonna fade away just as quick as the other one",1.0
So sad that there is a flaw in this product because it looks great on. The zipper is in the same place some fabric gets sewn together so it gets caught and stuck in the material when you try to zip it.,1.0
It’s cute but not as cute as it appears in photo,1.0
"I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder), and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!",1.0
So disappointed about this sweater. It was 2 sizes to big and very wide and certainly not the length shown here. In fact it was even a different color. Not flattering. I think I am done with Amazon clothes for now,1.0
Returned item twice and was unable to get size I ordered for my husbands birthday. Very disappointed. Shirt looks like it would of been nice.,1.0
"Weird fit, not even worth taking to the tailor. No structure to the suit. No shoulders, its just off in many ways. spend some more and get a much much better looking suit.",1.0
Didn’t like fabric,1.0
Unwearable due to extreme chemical smell. Washed twice and still so strong I can’t bring them in from garage. Zero stars and this company has clearly used the Levi’s logo on a fake.Edit- requested a replacement and will return these- if the replacement has the same chemical smell then they will also be returned.,1.0
"Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.",1.0

"Generally, i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent, so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition, the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this, and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!",1.0
After the first wash. Seams separated.  I had to sew them. Right side of shorts. Not buying again.,1.0
"I did not like the feel of the material.  I was hoping for a feeling of a ""traditional"" sweatshirt.  Love the tshirts I have of the ecosmart material so it's not the material. I think it is more of the cut that does not work for me.",1.0
This is bright pink. BRIGHT pink.,1.0
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.

for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,",1.0

"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",1.0
"I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.",1.0

Maybe if you are tiny!!!  I felt like a huge garbage bag!!!  Not flattering at all.  Too big as well.,1.0
I purchased and thought it looked great when I got it. The only problem is that after less than 10 washes it's slowly disappearing. The fabric on the bottom of the left side is now see through. I've purchased cheap t-shirts at Walmart for $5 that lasted much much longer than this one.,1.0

"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.",1.0

Jeans do not last longer than six months in my experience. Had a pair of Levi's I have had since high school and are in better shape than the jeans I picked up weeks ago. Denim is about a third as thick as it used to be. Very disappointed. Time to find a different brand I suppose!,1.0

This item has a run/whole in it when delivered. When trying to use the “free return” it states that the return being due to “defective item” does not justify free return and cost me $4.50 in stamps.,1.0

Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,1.0

I've been wearing Lee jeans for years and in April 2022 bought a pair through Amazon for the first time.  In August 2022 I noticed two small holes above the inside upper corners of the back pockets.  And the inside upper corner of the left pocket is tearing away.  It looks like the machine that sewed the back pockets punched 2 additional holes above each inner corner and may have missed fastening the top of the pockets. These jeans will soon be unwearable less than 6 months after I bought them.,1.0
This fit is more on the baggy side I’m more on the petite side and the small was too big,1.0

"Not the same as the Lee jeans that I've been buying for many, many years. I order a pair in January and the first time I wore them they fit great. Very relaxed as they should be. Then that afternoon I felt a draft on the back of my leg. I reached down only to find a tear in them. When I got home and put on an older pair. When I examined them, there was about a 1 inch by 1 inch right angle tear in them. After further tear examining them, there was another small tear next to the top of the rear pocket. I contacted Amazon and they replaced them right away.I started wearing the replacement pair. This was around mid February. Around 6 weeks ago, one of the bottom part of a belt loops tore off. Yesterday when I put these newest pair on I noticed the bottom part of another loops tore off. Examining them further, there are small tears next to the top of both rear pockets.Back in the day when I was working I used to buy anywhere from 4 and up to 12 pair of Lee jeans a year according to what kind of work I was doing. Now that I’m retired, I buy a new pair of jeans around once a year. I usually I have 1 new pair and around 4 to 5 old pairs to rotate. I’ve always mark the date that I bought them on the inside tags. So I know the older ones from the newer ones.  In the past 5 months, I only wore these jeans, maybe 25 to 30 days.Maybe I happened to get 2 defected pairs. I will buy one more pair and put them into rotation. If I have a problem again, I will have to try another brand.",1.0

I am so disappointing with Lee jeans these days. I ALWAYS bought them so they’re not something that are new to me. Within the last 6 years they’re manufactured must have changed. This is the 3rd pair I ordered hoping they would fit. I have 6 pairs of Lee jeans that were bought several years ago.  The ones I’ve recently tried just do. It fit at all. This time I bought 1 size bigger then the 6 pairs I have. I couldn’t get them up…. I was so mad I measured them against the pairs I have and they were literally 2 1/2 inches smaller in the width.

I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.,1.0

Besure that you read every line in the description  What good is a top without a bottom?  If you are only selling the top don't show the bottoms.  This is deceptive marketing and this is why many people don't like to buy online. For what you get it is way overpriced.,1.0

The whole piece that holds it has just evaporated on every single hoody like this I've owned in a couple years.  Don't buy this.  Just don't.

The fabric is not holding up.  None of the tears are related to the seams or wear, but the fabric itself.  It appears to not be the same quality that I have purchased in the past.

I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,1.0
"While the color was nice, the cut of the waist isn’t flattering. If you have a small waist/flatter tummy, the waist area has too much stretch and will cause the jeans to sag in the front.

This denim material is so thin! I have various Levi’s jeans and what I love most is that they are nice and thick. ESP since they’re high waisted as it makes the belly area more flattering. These are so thin and loose that it accentuates my belly and makes me look even rounder .. I hate it!! They also feel like such poor quality because of this! Would NOT recommend.,1.0
The only good thing I can say about this garment is that the material is good. The seamtress who assembled this jacket apparently is very inexperienced  or was having a very bad work day.

There is fraying at the bottom back of the shirt where the band meets the rest of the fabric. It's like little elastic threads. The fabric then appears pulled. This happened after the 3rd wash at least that is when I noticed it (since it was in the back). I really liked this shirt and have bout other colors of the same style but this one's fabric or construction was faulty. I'd like to try another one if the company would replace it. I am hesitant to buy others if this will happen outside of the return timeframe as this one did.,1.0

So this would be my second pair that did not fit. First was size 16 cause they said that size would fit if you were a size 14. So now a size 14 does not fit. Maybe this place sales pants that just don't or there fit is wrong either way I bought same pants at kohl's for 46 and a size 14 and they fit.

So I recently bought Levi's from a reputable store and normal wear a size 32. I saw that these run small so bought a size 34 and what the heck they don't even come close to fitting. See my picture the blue shorts are my confirmed Levi's and the back are the ones I bought here. The blue size 32s are way bigger and the tags/hardware are way different.,1.0
"I love my Levi jeans but these were more like leggings - I was expecting the material to be a little thicker denim, but it just felt like ill-fitted leggings that I'd broken in already.  I ordered my normal size 27 and the high waist fit well - for reference I'm 5' 3, 120-125 pounds.",1.0

"Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!), and worse, the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread, which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.

Jacket is well made. Fabric is stretchy.  Fabric shrinks alot! Fabric had a bad odor after washing in warm water using Gain detergent then  removing from dryer...bad odor.  So bad I had to spray essential oils on it so I could wear it.  Update:  I tried to wear this jacket sprayed with perfume.  It still has a bad odor.  So I washed it again in Clorox bleach. I put good scented dryer sheets in dryer.  When I opened the dryer it smelled bad (like human or animal poop).  Not as strong but still to stinky to wear.  I should be given a full refund.  I am throwing it in the trash!!! DO NOT BUY THIS JACKET!!!,1.0
"Ordered the green floral print (I already own this blouse in teal, which I am very happy with). As another reviewer noted, the fabric of the new blouse resembles a cheap outdoor table cloth.

I wore this once and the zipper broke. After I have it all zipped up it starts to open from the bottom up. I am going to take it in to have a new zipper put in because I really like it.

"Have bought many of these over the years and they were indeed tagless. However, although the product description still claims ""Tagless neck label for comfort"" that is no longer true. Not only weren't they tagless but both shirts actually had 2 tags sewn into them. After searching the Q&A and Reviews for the word tag, it appears many others are similarly disappointed in this new development. Being tagless was always one of the key features of these shirts going back to when they were first introduced. Hanes made a big deal out of it... and rightfully so. It's so much nicer not having physical tags scraping and scratching your neck. Therefore, I'm extremely disappointed in them for a) allowing this change to perpetuate despite all the customer complaints and b) making no effort to get the product description corrected so it doesn't keep misleading customers. Until that happens, if you also don't like receiving tagged shirts that were promised to be ""Tagless neck label for comfort"" then I suggest you return them using the reason of Not As Described and also post a review here. Hopefully, at some point, someone will finally do the right thing and take notice of this ongoing problem.",1.0

"What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months, i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases, it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside, the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely, it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h",2.0

I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,2.0

"I’m going to try to make this review as short as possible. Before ordering all 5 jeans (pictures 1-3) from this same page, I ordered one pair first to make sure the jeans fit. The jeans I ordered first are the darker jeans on picture #1.PICTURE #1 - In the first photo you’ll see two denim jeans, one light denim and one dark denim. Notice how both jeans have different tags on them: the light denim has a purple tag whereas the dark denim has a white tag. The white tag says, “AMANDA THE ORIGINAL SLIMMING JEAN” while the purple tag says, “AMANDA THE ORIGINAL DESIGNER JEAN”. So we can clearly see that they are NOT the same style jeans. Again, the dark denim jean fit me perfectly!PICTURE #2 - I ordered these other jeans, along with the light denim jean in picture 1, after trying on the the first pair. None of the jeans fit and they are all the size. The only difference is that some are Regular instead of Long but that shouldn’t matter because that has to do with the length. If one size 14 fits, all size 14s should fit.PICTURE #3 - this is another dark denim jean that I ordered. This is a different jean from the dark denim jean in picture 1. This jean is size 14 long just like the dark jean on picture 1 and it also fits perfectly!PICTURE #4 - all of the jeans (light denim, dark denim, black) are the same style; the light denim is size 14 Regular (this one doesn’t fit); the black jeans and the dark denim jeans are both 14 long, the SAME SIZE but the black one doesn’t fit whereas the dark denim does fit.Just keep that in mind when ordering. Not all size 14s will fit the same and you will not receive the exact same jeans. I received two different kinds: the  “AMANDA THE ORIGINAL SLIMMING JEAN” and the “AMANDA THE ORIGINAL DESIGNER JEAN”.NOT THE SAME JEANS!So remember, you can order 5 pairs of jeans the same size but most likely all of them won’t fit the same!I hope this review makes sense!!!!",2.0

"Loved the idea of this - unfortunately, it disappointed all around. it's way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5""7"" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend.",2.0
"I was so excited to buy this coat, since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original, and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat, and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.",2.0

"I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red, as well! however, this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.",2.0
"Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad",2.0
"Then this one is for you! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt, as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale. based upon the pictures, i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail, but it is actually masking this skirt's ugly secret:  a pouch. yes, it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen, which does not lay flat. the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots.                 this one",2.0

"I owned an Ascender jacket for many years and used it as a fleece layer for warmth.  And I love the fabric, which is somewhat water repellent unlike fleece.  As far as I could tell, Columbia is the only outdoor company that makes a lightweight jacket out of this material.This purchase was a replacement for the original jacket, which finally just wore out. I wish I could give this a higher rating. I took it on a recent trip to Iceland and used it every single day, since the temp there always hovered around 50 and it was rainy. The darn thing failed me, unfortunately.  This jacket zipper failed me in my hour of need. Unlike my original jacket, which had a beefy zipper with big teeth, this one had really fine teeth. The first time I zipped it up, it separated down at the bottom. Unless I was really careful when putting the zipper together, the separation happened frequently.  Once it separated, I always had a helluva time getting it unzipped again.Unless Columbia corrects the zipper issue, I would not buy this jacket again. Unfortunately I'm now past the return/refund window, so I'm going to pay someone to replace the zipper with a heavy duty one like the original.  :-(",2.0

This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium,2.0

length was decent in regulat size though, not too long. just too wide.",2.0
"Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so, so boxy - i'm thin, but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so, i had to return this, despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.",2.0

Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,2.0

Too baggy,2.0
I can’t figure out how to style it because it’s oversized but thin enough that you can nearly see the freckled on my arms through the sleeves. I would definitely not purchase this again.,2.0

It also seemed to be very cheaply made.,2.0
"I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one, buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not",2.0

"First of all- You should NEVER throw a dress suit that is meant to look fresh - rolled up in a ball in a plastic bag.

It's a nice suit, So what I want from you is a large vest - not this medium becuse I cant close it and nobody know I had a vest on. How do we handle this? can u replace the vest?

We ordered these for my teen through a try before you buy box. Everything in the box was added with looking at the sizing chart and these were the only returns (bought two different colors). This was supposed to fit my teen according to their measurements but these were way too large. My teen had to pull almost all of the drawstring out to even get them to stay up which then caused them to have a really weird drapery effect (they looked like partially closed drapes). These were also too short on the leg which would have made them an inappropriate length.  The sizing chart was not helpful for these shorts as they were way too large for my teen based on their measurements. I hope this review was helpful for you and thank you for reading!,2.0

"I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off, it's about 3 sizes too big. second off, it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.",2.0
"I ordered this cute drop shoulder cardigan and was very excited when I received it.  After trying on and wearing around the house I noticed the sweat knit immediately started to pull.  Fuzz balls everywhere.  Not just wear the fabrics rubbed but everywhere.  Around the cuff of the sleeve, down the front, back and lots of fuzzy balls. The fabric was inexpensive and of very poor quality. It unfortunately did not compensate the poor quality fabric used.  Too bad.",2.0
"If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person, i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3"" and 115lbs, this dress is not too short. however, the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so.",2.0
"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",2.0
"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.",2.0
"When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it:
___________
pros:
- the colors you see online are exactly the same in person.
- the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh",2.0
"Cute, but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!",2.0
"This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.",2.0
"I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h",2.0
"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",2.0
I normally wear a L or XL (depending on length). The XL in this was still really short and tight. Bot very comfortable. Will be returning.,2.0
I’ve tried these shirts in multiple sizes and they just don’t cut it. They shrink lengthwise after one wash and then they are super boxy or not form fitting.,2.0
one side was longer than the other. Material was not great.,2.0
I’m going to have to lose about 20lbs for me to love this. There’s no stretch but the print was so cute I took a chance.,2.0
The quality was sadly questionable and the reason for my return. One pair came with loose threads all over the place and another had a hole along the outer side seam immediately upon opening to try on. The zipper area on the pockets was also outrageously stiff and super uncomfortable and the zippers didn’t function very well.,2.0
"This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt, it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy, marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer, requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way, unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally, the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh",2.0
"If you're 5'8 or taller dont bother. It his your hip and torso area really weird. And the straps are weird, too short, and non-adjustable. It's too bad cuz it is a cute dress.",2.0
I am 6’4 235. The XXL fits like a smaller XL. The sleeves ended way before my wrist meaning this will have to be a rolled up shirt. Feels like a cheap shirt. Did not meet my expectations.,2.0
"I don't have a picture, but what I received is not as advertised. The blouse I received is not sheer at all and the material is heavy. It's not at all like the pictures as advertised. I'll try to take a pic and add here when I get a chance. The one they sent me is the right colour and I'll be able to use it in the winter, but it's definitely not a sheer summer blouse.",2.0
Unfortunately these were very see through.,2.0
"Haven’t even washed it yet, and it has ripped.I wear a jean jacket with it because the elastic sleeves make me feel childish.I like the length. It is quite large on me around the middle, but that’s what makes it very comfortable. Thin material (I always think I should probably put on a slip which defeats the purpose of this lightweight dress.)",2.0
The quality is ok but size description is not accurate.. ordered a medium and was still big..I'm 5-10  175lb..small would have been ok..,2.0
"I had a pair that I really liked, so decided to get another one in a different color.  This pair is not made the same.  It appears a bit cheaply made, especially the shorts.  I got this pair on sale, but If it had been full price I would have returned it.",2.0
"I'm 5'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful.",2.0
Cut small and over priced,2.0
Do not like fabric or color,2.0
So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,2.0
"The fabric in these pants is very light. I bought gray, which I kept, but returned the white ones. You could see right through them.The comfort waist was a definite plus, but overall I was disappointed",2.0
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful, but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere, my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me, as well. possibly great for pregnancy, because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.",2.0
"The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery, details, and soft material are great, but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.",2.0
Love the colors! I purchased 2 shirts … fit is good… but they come out of dryer with lot of wrinkles and for someone who hates ironing this is a big negative for the shirts. Wrinkle release spray helps if you get it right out of dryer,2.0
"The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.
i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.",2.0
However it came with no price or company tag whatsoever and no neck tag stating what the size even is.. I felt the blouse had been previously worn (not a good first impression) I washed it & wore it and was fine,2.0
"These pants are made with nice material, but fit extremely tight in the thigh. I suggest if purchasing these pants and you don't want puffy pockets, and tight fit, go up a size.",2.0
Not flattering and run big.,2.0
Quality too bed,2.0
"Arrived and felt super crispy, I was hoping when I washed them it would soften them up but unfortunately they remain crispy.",2.0
Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.,2.0
"I got these in the mail today and to me, they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though",2.0
"These did not fit well. The waist band was too low, did not hit my waist in the right position.",2.0
I was looking forward to the pants but was so disappointed in the sizing. I couldn't even get them up my leg.,2.0
"This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on, but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length), it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length, which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.",2.0
"The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist, but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s, and i could have sized down 1, maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.",2.0
"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin",2.0
Pants were baggy,2.0
I did not like this blazer. Fit was weird and it was cheap material. Pockets were unusually large. Sent it back would not recommend,2.0
"I’m upset because these shorts are so cute and good material, but they’re WAY too small. I wear a size 14 pants, but saw that the reviews states they run small so I got the xxl and couldn’t even pull the button closed.",2.0
"On first glance, this is a nice jacket but once you put it on, it is just a bad choice of fabric. There is no stretch whatsoever, which makes it feel like a straight jacket, not something I'd want to wear while physically performing patient care. Nice idea, awful fabric. No stretch at all through the arm and shoulder.",2.0
They are durable  but they are soooo sheer that you could always see your underwear even if your wear white . They also run big,2.0
The material is not soft enough but the fit was good.,2.0
"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece, casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail, the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that, too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame, and i ordered an extra small, and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",2.0
It’s super cute but after only a few wears little lint balls created from friction on the sleeve & now it’s appealing to the eye.,2.0
"I really wanted to like this dress, but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.",2.0
"This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering, it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape, but alas, i did not look good in this.
the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.",2.0
"I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.",2.0
"The material is great.  Soft,  flows beautifully. My only complaint is it is a dark blue not a light blue like in the picture.  If it wasn't going to be such a hassle to return, I would.  Well probably give it away.",2.0
The sleeves are to long and the neck line was not flattering.,2.0
"I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday, however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also, it runs small and was tight.",2.0
"The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru, though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.",2.0
"I pretty much am in agreement with the first, original reviewer on here. big disappointment, especially if you have hips and are busty.

pros:
- great breathable fabric.
- cute look overall.
- sash in front brings it all together.
- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.

"I have several of these shirts for my husband. They were a great find for plain t-shirts that were long enough on him. However I would only buy them on sale, because even just a year ago they seemed too expensive for just a plain t-shirt.  Now they have gone up at least $4 a shirt, no longer worth it.",2.0
"They're alright.The fit is okay but that's really about it. The color is off from shirt to shirt. Some are darker, some are lighter.They aren't soft, there kinda rough/crunchy.",2.0
This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.,2.0
Top has no give making it uncomfortable at night also it’s weight is very much Not light. It’s like a flannel that’s not soft and broken in. Not very comfortable for PJs.  Prints cute but not the summer Jammie’s I was looking for.,2.0
"I have had this sweater about a month. I honestly really loved it but after just a few washes, it ripped right on the seam.",2.0
The neck was too high n tight.,2.0
"This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.",2.0
"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",2.0
Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!,2.0
"Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all.",2.0
"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy, it was too flimsy, the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough, just didn't flow very well.",2.0
Bought these for my high schooler to have some back up gym shorts. The fabric is so sheer you can almost see through both layers. Also feels scratchy and all around pretty cheap.If you are a runner maybe these would be great since they are so light weight but for pretty much anything else I can’t imagine it being a great choice.,2.0
"I am 5'8"", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it",2.0
"This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.",2.0
"The jeans are meant to be relaxed fit. Instead they're tight. Trying to bend knees, sit, or kneel doesn't work well. Very tight, as if they were not relaxed fit.",2.0
"Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second, it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third, need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.",2.0
I've had them a few weeks and i already have to get new ones bc there not even ripping there shredding and it's kinda sad cus I kinda loved them. I'm not sure if it's cus I have big thighs tho.,2.0

This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.,2.0

Runs very small- very tight. No stretch. See through,2.0
Pockets are far too shallow.,2.0
The style is wrecked by inconsistency in sizing.,2.0
I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,2.0
The vest itself is very nice. My ten year old is not tall and this seemed a bit short. The biggest issue was the vest is a Slim Fit and is listed as a regular fit.,2.0

Just for leisurewear,2.0
The first time I wore these I thought I really liked them. The second time I realized how cheaply made they were. They started rolling up due to how cheap and thin the fabric was. The fit it great (at first) but don't expect to get very many wears out of these.,2.0
I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.,2.0

No one is surprised by a tshirt that shrinks slightly in the wash. It's a part of how textiles work. This shirt however tried to disappear entirely after the first wash.

my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.

Liked these pants so much I took the time to wash them three times. Alone in the washer and the dryer. The first time with detergent and water. Badly wrinkled. Last two times washed them with fabric softener and fabric sheets. Taking the pants out as soon as the washer and the dryer finished. Made no difference at all. So wrinkled that to wear out in public you would have to iron them. I’m not willing to do that with a polyester blend fabric.,2.0

"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model, where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was, i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7""",2.0

I think the shirts i got had been made incorrectly.  They may have been authentic polo brand but i believe they were probably deeply discounted at one point for being defective.

"I ordered the Levi’s Women’s 721 High Rise Skinny Jean in Azure Mood, size 26 regular (= size 2, 30” long),  BECAUSE is it is advertised as 92% cotton and only 6% Poly and 2% Elastic.  I wanted the higher cotton content, and less stretch.  I knew as soon as I opened the package that these WERE NOT 92% cotton.  Waaay too much stretch to the fabric, and I wanted more “jean,” less “legging.”  These jeans, made in Sri Lanka consist of 71% Cotton (not 92%), 26% Viscose, 6% polyester, and 2% Elastine.  These jeans were oddly  tighter in the waist than the 720s I tried, and had far too much stretch otherwise…no control, no shaping.  Since Levi’s sold out, and stopped manufacturing all of their jeans in the USA, the manufacturer has lost its ability for reliable quality control or to uphold the traditional LEVI reputation.  Of course, there are Levi’s  jeans still made in the USA, but they aren’t affordable for most people looking for a well made, durable, but stylish pair of jeans.",2.0

I wear a size 12/14 which should be a large. I love that the length was actually perfect because I bought the short. I tried them on and they were TIGHT in the hips and went up my behind!

I was able to order a size XL to get here in hopefully 2 days before I leave and pay $13 more than the large. But I can't get the short ($28 more!!!) or petite ($13 more) in time.

only use for one week and it wash out the color.i was so disappointed,2.0
This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.,2.0
"Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them, but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.",2.0
"This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream, but wow is it short! i'm 5'8"" and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans. the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected. it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse. 

because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt, i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies, but tall & curvy ladies beware.",2.0
"Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!",2.0
It smells terrible.  Question a return and the manufacture put it in a plastic bag that Locked in the stink and resold it?  Very disappointed.,2.0
"The pictures and the product are not the same, since returning is such a hassle I didn’t, the print is not  neat and crisp, some kind of odd digital print. So many better outfits on amazon. Don’t bother with this one.",2.0
"I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.",2.0
This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.,2.0
"I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no",2.0
Waist was too tight.,2.0
These are transparent! Can see my som’s underwear through them. The fabric is kind of scratchy,2.0
"I wanted to like these pants.  The fabric is good and they seem well-constructed.  The pockets are shallower than I'd like, which is unfortunate, but the deal killer for me is that the crotch is cut way too high.  You have to be careful putting them on to avoid injuring yourself, since the split between the pantlegs happens much sooner than one would expect.  Once they're on, the lack of room in the crotch means that the seam in the back continually tries to insert itself between my cheeks.  I don't want to show rear cleavage at work, so I'm passing these on.  (I'll note that I even ordered a larger waist size than usual.)",2.0
the jacket is huge but the pants run really small.,2.0
"No free return shipping, so just holding onto it.",2.0
"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",2.0
I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.,2.0
The chart y'all got for the size is for midget people cause clothes are really small also the quality of materials are really bad,2.0
"This top is gorgeous and beautifully made. however, the fit leaves a lot to be desired. the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin. i tried to make this work but just couldn't, so it's going back.",2.0
The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.,2.0
"I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it, so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.",2.0
"A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics, scarves and jewelry. so, i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses, even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived, i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes, so it is going back asap.",2.0
I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.,2.0
"Fits great, especially for a dude with long legs and a big butt. However, rips in the fabric appeared under light use after less than a month. A second pair did the same thing. Bafflingly poor quality",2.0
"I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well, but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said "" [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric."" this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav",2.0
"Poorly made, 1st time worn stitching unraveled . Bought them for vacation way in advance and to late to return. If you purchase this item check the stitching out right away.",2.0
Real thin,2.0
"I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin, it might work for you too.",2.0
"I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on, it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.",2.0
"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack.",2.0
"The stone color was nice, but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.",2.0
Length is great and they're definitely squat proof but the band cuts off its not as flattering as you'd like,2.0
Poor quality. Wondering if the product is really made by Calvin Klein.,2.0
The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.,2.0
"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store, in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily, my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol",2.0
Shrinks the minute you wash it!,2.0
I am very disappointed the suit is not true to size. I brought a size 12 and it is so tight it can’t even button. There is no way I can return because I live in Trinidad. I should have order a size 14.,2.0
"The material is a bit weird, longer in the front and back then I expected sadly, I ordered a xs for it to be more fit to my body and I’m usually a small even medium at times, but this felt baggy for me I’m 5’3 and 127lb and my bra size is 34 D and it’s baggy, it’s definitely sheer you’d have to wear something white underneath.. I would share a picture but it looks so weird.",2.0
"Unless you're wearing tight compression shorts or a cup these will leave little to the imagination. The material feels strange, not like any other Under Armor shorts I've tried. I'm suspicious they aren't guniune. Length was just over 9 inch. They'll do for the right price if showing off is your thing and you can get past the fabric.",2.0
"Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.",2.0
"This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c",2.0
"This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric, especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however, the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition, the bow seemed to be too t",2.0
"I love how these jeans look on. tts, adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.",2.0
"I ordered first the green, then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)
so short!!
is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??
anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.
i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!
note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.
i wear these pants in a tall, and live",2.0
Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.,2.0
Unfortunately these pants aren’t quite long enough but they fit perfectly in the waist. My legs are pretty slender but I had hoped that these would fit a little better. I had purchased another pair of this model and they fit me much better in the legs. These are too generous and more of an old lady straight leg. I have long legs and so I usually need along. Very hard to find it these days!,2.0
"I like this top and am keeping it, but I find myself having to keep pulling it down as it slides up on my neck so that it doesn't sit properly.",2.0
Fit is flattering nice length if your tall however wrinkles and must be steamed or ironed and material stains easily.,2.0
"I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!
just didn't work on my slim build. :(",2.0
The jacket itself was cute but it smelled like straight ammonia when I opened the package,2.0
"This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large, as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite, but this one is a return.",2.0
"Based off of my fiancé’s measurements, he would wear a L; however, I ordered an XL as well to be safe. The package arrived quickly, but didn’t look anything like the pictures. The vest looked cheap, color didn’t match, L was even too big and there were what looked like grease stains on the vests already. Not impressed.",2.0
"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",2.0
I read the labels very clearly what the description is saying. I bought this jacket because it said it was cotton which it is but the liner inside the jacket is 100% polyester which was not clarify to me the day of purchase. So I am highly allergic to polyester which I feel should be noted in the description for people who have allergies towards closing,2.0
"I am returning these because they are way too short. Athletic shorts this short need to have the lining in them, and these don’t. Super bummed.",2.0
"I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me.",2.0
"I washed these pajamas before I wore them. The forearms and wrists were a bit tight, and as others mentioned, the top button was too low. But I also found that either the chemicals from overseas manufacturing either hadn't  rinsed out, or I have a sensitivity to the modal fabric. These were itchy, my throat tightened up, and my mouth tasted like chemicals. Unfortunately, I can't wear these pajamas.",2.0
legs were too big,2.0
The fabric feels cheap And does not fall well. The center seam is also a little weird. Not cute.,2.0
"I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty, the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant, it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this, along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.",2.0
"There is no structure. It fits more like a sweater. Size down one for better fit. It is light weight, but not what I expected.",2.0
"This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably, i had to return it since it wasn't lined.",2.0
"The jeans fit well, comfortable stretch & are flattering. However, after a few steps the inseam twists around & runs down the middle of my kneecap. At that point, the inseam along the hem is on the top of my foot. Every few steps I feel the need to correct the seam placement. Needless to say, I doubt there will be a repeat purchase.",2.0
"I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it, it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup, the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.",2.0
"Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. 
why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.",2.0
"Sleeves were tight, was difficult to put on ?. for the price, you want to love the shirt. sending it back.",2.0
"I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.
the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.",2.0
"I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also, the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale, but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but",2.0
There wasn’t the 3 piece in the package. Just the coat and pant. I’m very disappointed with this.,2.0
Color didn't look good on me.,2.0
"I ordered a size larger because I was hoping to have extra room in case I wore a bulky shirt under, but this tan way too small! I would have needed 2 sizes larger than I normally wear. 😳",2.0
One of those blouses that shrinks in length after first wash. But the sleeves are still super long. Even washed on a delicate setting.Loved the thicker material but “shrunk up” weirdly I washed.  I have a longer torso so that pretty much renders this a dust cloth. Disappointed. Sharing to help someone else avoid wasting money.,2.0
Poor quality fabric and design. I wore them once then threw them in the trash.,2.0
"I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.",2.0
"This pant for $30+ needs to be much more. Very generic, plastic feeling. I wear a 38x30. Ordered a 40x30 to be safe. Very tight and about an inch up to ankle. Would need to go up 2 sizes in waist and a least 2 in length. Obviously came folded and wrinkled but had a helluva time getting wrinkles free. Was not impressed at all.",2.0
"I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.",2.0
"Pants looks beautiful on my daughter that is size 8, I wear size 18 and asked for XXL. Size is not right. Feels stretchy, nice to the look, elegant and great blue color. Wrong size in my opinion.",2.0
"A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however, after 5 minutes of wear, it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath, i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.",2.0
"I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d",2.0
"The red pair, while wearing, faded onto my underwear.  Have set the dye with vinegar, and machine washed two times.  Hope they won't keep fading. Otherwise good value for the price.",2.0
These pants are very disappointing. The fabric is good quality but the pants don't hold there shape past the first wash. They are very large in the waist and tend to droop and puddle around the ankle. They always feel like they are going to fall off.,2.0
"This top was too big for me. 5'4, 135lbs and ordered xxs. fit was fine and wanted it too work, but too overwhelming on me as well. will be going back.",2.0
"These shorts have every potential to be your favorite pair of work shorts. They’re light weight, easy to put on. But, they aren’t durable and won’t last if your line of work is tough.  I’m a Framer and these lasted only 2 weeks before ripping to unwearable conditions. Probably better for landscaping.",2.0
Loved the neckline and detail however it was far too small and I returned it.,2.0
"This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous, unique, and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp",2.0
"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.",2.0
The quality is lacking in these pants at this price point the pockets are tight so reaching in getting something out my pocket is bs the pockets have fallen apart there's a hole in one side I have a nother 30 dollar pair from Amazon and they held up these didnt,2.0
"Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.",2.0
Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,2.0
"I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me.",2.0
"The set is very soft and comfortable. However, I lost almost all of the buttons within 24 hours and had to sew them back on.",2.0
"These shirts are both way too large (circumference), and way too small (length) compared to size chart. They are very short and very boxy. If you're a short and round guy, these fit the opposite of a slim fit, and may be perfect for you. These XL fit me like a midriff showing trash bag (I am 6'1"", 200 lbs, and not very slim in the middle, and I was still swimming in this shirt, while it still was too short to even come to my belt line).The polyester fabric feels nice, compared to sweaty hot cotton. Otherwise, stick to a tried and true Port Authority polo if you're looking for a work shirt with a familiar fit. AmazonBasics totally missed the mark with this shirt.",2.0
"I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !",2.0
The Elastic around the Shoulders Completely Stretched Out with only 2 Uses. I had to take it in on both sides Front and Back,2.0
"The dress is very pretty, but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold, given the photo, but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.",2.0
"I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me.",2.0
I ended up returning this dress. It looked way to big on me and looked very much like a nightgown. I ordered a medium since I normally wear medium in other dresses. This is perfect if you are looking for a nightgown. It's super soft and roomy.If you want to wear as a dress sizing down might be more flattering.,2.0
"I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton, and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur",2.0

After my first wash I noticed a spot on front. Could be a stain. But it didn't wash. From driver it is wrinlkled.,2.0
"First of all, mine arrived in a regular denim shade, not the dark wash shown. also, the style is more like a blazer, and it was huge. i am 5'2"" and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer. as well, the sleeves came barely past my wrists, they are designed to cuff as the model has done? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic! the quality is excellent with some nice details. this might be one to try in person, if you can.",2.0
"As others have stated, this shirt runs a bit large, but knowing that before you buy should alleviate that issue.My main beef is that this shirt has 6 buttons. Depending on where your trousers sit, this may or (more likely) may not be enough. It should have at least seven, if not eight as other comparable brands have. My shirt looks sloppy near my belt line. This is such a simple fix, but they seem to have cut corners here. Very disappointed.",2.0
"I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.",2.0

"The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.",2.0
I was disappointed to learn that this product was made in China if I had known that I would not have bought it. I’m more inclined to support my own country. And actually the product had a very very strange smell,2.0
"Frankly I didn’t even try it on, because I could tell that 1) the pants would be too long and too baggy (if the rest had been ok the plan was to get some skinnier pants); and 2) the top jacket thing was far longer than I wanted; and 3) I would have looked like my grandmother. And I ain’t no spring chicken!",2.0
I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly. it makes me look like a football player! i am 5'8 135/athletic build and i was swimming in the m. i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads. it hangs and gaps awkwardly. the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short.,2.0
I am little bit disappointed. I did not like the top. The only one thing I like is it is cotton.,2.0

"I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!",2.0

"I so wanted to love this dress, especially after seeing how pretty the ladies look who shared photos, but the fit and proportions were terrible on my bod. I am curvy/busy with ""normal"" proportions; I'm neither long- nor short-waisted. The waist on this dress was waaaay too short,  it landed in the middle of my bust. The side button, therefore, was totally ineffective. The fabric was nice, stretchy and flowy, and work-appropriate. I'm sorry I had to return it.",2.0
I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.,2.0

The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,2.0

Not high waisted,2.0
"This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up, and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining",2.0

I'm 5'11"", 185lbs with an athletic build and it seemed like the large would be the correct size for me. The overall length and arm length are both what they should be, but the body of the jacket is ridiculously baggy. I mean hilariously baggy. I could almost fit two of my torso in the jacket and still button it comfortably. If this is built for heavy-set people, they should note that in the description. It's insanely baggy with no form of any kind. It's a parachute with sleeves. If I jumped out of an airplane in this thing, I could probably glide to safety like one of those flying squirrels. I tried washing it to shrink it a bit, but all that did was significantly fade the color, and one of the sleeve buttons fell off. Maybe a size small would have fit my torso better, but then the overall length and arm length would be way too short. Super lame.",2.0

Inferior construction!  The seams are only surged so the seams open in the crotch area. But these are the softest and most comfortable pajama pants I've ever had.

I bought these because I guess I assumed they have a liner.  My daughter needed black running shorts for cross country meets so I searched black running shorts and these came up.

"The fabric’s texture gives away that it’s a cheap blazer. I have my fair share of cheap-but-good Amazon finds, but this one…not so much. The button looks big, too bulbous, and tacky.

If the jacket wasn’t too big and I decided to keep it, I’d literally replace the button.The fabric weave isn’t smooth enough to fool anyone — it’s obviously medium-low quality. Not thin, but its medium-weight feel doesn’t do enough to hide that it’s poor quality. No way could I wear this to a job interview in person. It might work if it was via Zoom.Size L — I often wear sizes medium and large. I got a Large. I’m 145 lbs, 5’4” 38D with broad shoulders, narrow waist, broad hips. The large was BIIIIIG on me. Too big to wear it as a fashionably oversized blazer. It didn’t taper at the waist enough either, so even if it fit me overall, I suspect it would’ve been boxy, and again, not fashionably so on me. Doesn’t have that 90s blazer look. If you’re an apple shape, it might work for you.Too long overall. The arms are eeextra long, and I have somewhat long arms. I suspect the medium would’ve been too long there as well. That said, if you want to wear it with the sleeves cuffed, you can show off the inner lining—that material is quite nice, actually.All-in-all, you’re better off finding a budget blazer at H&M, Ross, etc. I’m returning this and not bothering with trying the medium.

All of the shirts seem to fit a little bit different. They're all just slightly different sizes. Some of them shoulders were a little narrower somewhere a little wider. Some of the sleeves are a little longer. Some little shorter biggest issue is the sleeve section between the armpit and under bicep is about a 15th of an inch long. So you end up with a shoulder cap and then if you're a bigger size the shirt will go down to your knees. So length is as expected but sleeves are jacked up and there is no consistency. Might as well buy clothes from the flea market.,2.0

The cut of the jacket length was too short for my height.  The material was low quality and the fake handkerchief looked like it was made of roughly cut paper.

The jacket I got was too long in the sleeves and the stitches in the hem were crooked making the bottom pucker.

"The problem with one size, is that it fits a very small percentage of body types. I should have known better, but the cuteness of the pattern convinced me to purchase it against my better judgment. I am 5’7”, 185 pounds, hourglass figure with a short torso (with mostly boobs that are DDD). My arms aren’t overly long but this sweater was even too short in that respect. This sweater is tight and stretchy, which is the most uncomfortable combination. Plus my torso being so short did nothing to help this very small/boxy fit. So many strikes against it. I usually wear a large or xl, and if your body type is anything like mine than just trust me- this WILL NOT fit you. Yes it’s cute, but now it’s in my closet under the “I’ll wear this when I’m 140 lbs again” clothing graveyard. And nothing will fix the wonky sleeve length unless I cut my arms off. Save your money. If this fits you well, enjoy it; you’re in the 5%.",2.0

"I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person, but that's about it for me. thoughts below:

pros:
- tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c, 5'9"" frame and found it sufficient.
- the color is much nicer in person, as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color.
- the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it",2.0
"I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem, but i wanted to give the fair warning!",2.0

I thought this would be a cooler outfit option in the heat but my bazongas were hanging out for all the world to see. Shoulder seam is too far forward making the front saggy and the V exceptionally deep. I will probably try to tack the front closed since I already wore it but tape would not fix the issue. There was too much slack in the front but the back rode up thats why I think its due to the shoulder seam. Smaller girls might not have an issue.,2.0

Was told by the coach to buy these pants for my 8 year old son.  He fits in a size right between 8 and 10 for most pants but since most pants run either size 8 or 10-12 this has been a problem because the length is usually right but the waist is way too large.  I bought both the size 8 and the size 10.  We kept the size 8 and returned the 10 because the length and the waistband on the 10 were huge in comparison to most of the other pants he owns.  The 8 was exactly the correct length.  Not flood pants and not dragging on the ground and the waist was comfortable but not too snug.  The sheerness is a problem.  I was told to buy all white socks with no stripes and white boxer briefs because you can see through these pants.  I would have expected better from a brand like Under Armour.

"I tugged at the waistband, then pulled these on without even unbuttoning or zipping! That's how stretchy these pants are at the top. Too weird. I even ordered a sized down. They probably shouldn't have even fit at all. They weren't huge, but I wanted them to fit better in places for my aging body - lol. I wanted the fabric to consist of mostly cotton. I mean, they're Levi's, right? I didn't want leggings type fabric. The style is very good, not skinny, not wide, or boot-cut. Very straight like 90s jeans. The fabric is far more substantial than, say, ON jeans.  Also, the description states the size Short pants should be 27/30, but they are actually labeled 27/28 size 4 in reality. Disappointing. Will be sizing down *again* and ordering 26 Regular, hoping the length will be 30"" as I've seen in another review. Will probably update later.Update: Received replacement and they were imperfect, some kind of stain or something on the leg. Pants are so incredibly stretchy, not really what I expected in Levi's at all. Not the quality I was expecting. Also, even the smallest size available 26 (2) reg could probably fit size 6. They seem ok for around the house I guess. Not wide legged, similar to slim straight 90s jeans. Short is 28"", Regular length is 30"". Rise is a little bit higher on me than mid rise.Final decision:  I think these are too stretchy and have such a low cotton content, they don't really feel like Levi's, more like Levi's Signature jeans. They're really just too stretchy and loose in the lower stomach that they're not flattering there. I expected better from Levi's.",3.0

They not like compression shorts after the band. I love that they are seamless in the front to prevent my notorious camel from showing but I'm not sure this look is better.  The legs part was a little longer than expected and when you pull them up they are even less unflattering.

"Based on other reviews that this top ran large, i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size), and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats, so the bottom of this top really, really, really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin, and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.",3.0

It's a decent jacket at a good price but the detachable hood is not very practical. The hood attaches to two 'tails' that extend all the way down to the bottom of the jacket.

This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,3.0
"I loved this dress and tried on the xs in the store and then ordered the petite. i thought if i ordered the petite it would not be as baggy. it is just way to boxy/baggy for someone my height and weight. however i would recommend to someone taller because the velvet is great quality and it would have been an amazing dress to have for fall and also for winter. for reference i am 5'0"" and weight 113 pounds.",3.0
"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated, it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree, the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it, but if i do, i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference, i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0.",3.0

"I think some other reviews mention a chemical smell when these arrive. In my experience they understated the case by an extent that is difficult to describe.  These reeked when they arrived, to the point that the room I left them in overnight still stank to an uncomfortable degree a whole day after I removed them.  And it's not just a chemical smell; it is that, but somehow it also conjures a strong undertone of aged sewage and rotting rat.  They are fine otherwise (except the size/shape of the pockets is a little weird), and running them through the washer two or three times in a row cleared up the smell.  If you order these, plan to not open the plastic bag they arrive in until you have the time to immediately do laundry on repeat, because you don't want to spend any amount of time with these unsealed in their natural state.  Oddly, the walnut color version of these that I bought at the same time didn't smell at all, but both pair of black ones were an olfactory abomination (judging solely by the smell, likely also a fire hazard and known to cause cancer in the state of California).",3.0

"I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans, as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans, they fit very well. however, for the price, they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose, even after 20 wears",3.0

I've never owned jeans that naturally faded with lines across the front of them like that so I'm not sure what the look is that they're trying to achieve.But what the heck, these are supposed to be authentic and some of the colorways have lines and some don't. I just want regular old comfortable Wrangler jeans. I'll wear them out in my own way, thank you very much. It's too much trouble to return them so I'll live with the lines, but I'll be more careful next time I order jeans to make sure the manufacturers haven't dyed lines across them.

I originally got a size L and it was way too small so I returned and got a 2xl. Great fit and comfy second time around but when I tried them on my run….no go. I had terrible chafing on my inner thighs not 15 minutes into my run. Not runner friendly if you had big thighs.

I bought theses for my husband who wears a medium. He is 5'6 close to 5'7 and around 165lbs. These were way too small and tight on him. Idk if they run small but theses don't fit like normal medium on him. He does like how light weight they are so I'm going to be returning these for a larger size.

The only problem is that the more you wash them, (and more specifically dryer drying) the thinner they get, the amount of lint that collects from these shirts is quite unbelievable.  Hence with every wash they get thinner and thinner, to the point of being nearly see-through.  Now I wash and hang to dry.

It's ridiculous. With how much they cut corners for quality, you'd think that would afford them to ability to produce some of these pants in more sizes that accommodate thin people, or cut the price down to what these things are actually worth.

I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.,3.0

That being said, I think they are Levi’s cheaper line that they make for their outlet and places like Target. I have been to the Levi’s outlet and their wedgies fit like these ones, so I think they are authentic. They have way more stretch to them, way less “denim.” Wedgies fromNordstrom are much more stiff and less stretch, which is what I like since they have less spandex and more denim. That said, I think these are authentic, but lower line Levi’s, which makes sense given the cheaper price. This price is the same as the outlet price. So my recommendation: if you have never had wedgies, you may like these. If you have wedgies from a department store and love them, you won’t like the fit of these at all. I returned mine.",3.0

"I'd previously ordered a medium in Navy (May 2021) and the fit was what I'd call ""relaxed."" I kept them because, though I like long pants more fitted, a pair of loose shorts is perfect for lounging around the house, gardening, or exercise (a kind of ""full"" fit that allows completely unrestricted movement).  Back then, I used the Amazon recommendation to determine my size selection. (It was based on purchases of size 4 32"" inseam Wrangler jeans and Baleaf highwaisted size S 32"" length yoga pants and Prana size 2 reg Halle hiking pants among other orders.) In other words, I bought what I ""knew"" was one size too big, because I wanted exactly that ""full"" fit. (My stats are: 5'8"", 130 lbs, waist 26"", hips 36.5"".)This most recent pair is Light Steel. Right out of the package, the fit on them is beyond loose. I am hoping they'll shrink, because they are NOT at all flattering -- too long (touching my kneecaps!) and tent-like in the waist and hips.

The jacket is super cute on but the material is super synthetic. The only way I can describe it is it feels like the same thing used on a cheap wig. It’s not soft at all and definitely not anything close to Sherpa. I kept it because it is so cute on but I don’t wear it often because it feels so cheap.,3.0
This product runs small. Don’t expect it to fit like a normal sweatshirt- it is very tight in the stomach and chest and the thick fabric has no give to it- no stretch at all.

What I REALLY LIke about these pants is that they are available in 32x29.  29 length is really hard to find.  The elastic waistband is also great.

The biggest issues are the following:The first and weirdest is that if you look at the photo (and it's hard to see), there are tiny yellowish strands that appear on the surface as the pants wear.  At first I thought I had brushed up against some pollen, but after washing and wearing they are becoming more numerous on high traffic spots.  I haven't figured out how to get rid of them.  I feel like if they weren't there, the pants wouldn't look faded.Second, the back pockets ARE too small (see the one start reviews).  My wallet has dropped out twice, luckily in the car as I was getting out.  The left rear stitching also came apart causing me to not be able to use it until a repair was done.Why three stars?  Because they fit me correctly, and the zip pocket on the side is useful.  The durability is the question, I've had these for daily wear for around 5 months.

"First, it is a nice looking coat and it feels warm enough. But I have a few complaints with it.First, the zipper pull is on the left side. This is very irritating. Men's coats in the US do not have zippers on the left side.Second, it was a pretty snug fit when I first tried it on, but I was worried the next size up would be too large. What I didn't realize was that trying to wear the coat with a sweater definitely made it too small.After a couple of wearings, I regret not sending it back.",3.0

this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7"" and it hit me right at the knee, so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring",3.0

"The dress had great potential, but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately, i had to return it. the length was great, and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust, and it didn't work for me.",3.0

I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.,3.0
I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.,3.0

"I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body, however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve",3.0

"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy, so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i returned it for a size 2, which fit much better. in the end, i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape, and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made, but it just wasn't for me.",3.0
The seam in the rear center doesn't seen to be to strong and I feel it will start opening in time.,3.0
I’ll start off with I’m a slender 5’9 female. I ordered a large for comfort and length (usually a small/medium) and the sleeves are still short on me. I got the champagne color and it appears see through too. Not ideal for my wedding day photos of the bridal party getting ready.,3.0

"This is a pretty jump suit, true to size, looked flattering on me, lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however, the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work, so back it went to the store.",3.0

Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.,3.0

I really like the style and the color… got a lot of compliments… I ordered a medium… I found it a bit big… also.. the two side buttons popped off as I was tightening the waist of the vest to make it fit better.

"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too",3.0
"This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty, but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work, but it was just so impractical.",3.0
"I ordered up from my usual size 4. I went up two sizes actually because I love roomy tops and figured I would adjust the pajama shorts. That supposed size 6 top fits like a 5 but the shorts do fit like a 6. The elastic used for the ruffles is thermoplastic polyurethane and it itches and scratches. I will have to cut that off of the sleeves and pant legs. The material is very comfortable, but if you don’t know how to sew and make adjustments, I don’t think it’s worth it.",3.0

"This dress fit me fine (XL, 5'4"") and in fact I prob could have gone smaller. It's a cute style.  However the front is cut too low, and the fabric (100% viscose) would be a nightmare to wash/iron. I've returned it",3.0

"I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty, perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty, but the fit is selective, so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.",3.0
"Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy, and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit ""off,"" as the background color is a gray, which doesn't flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large, as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow, but it was very tight all around, especially around the bust area. going to have to return this...",3.0

I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.,3.0
This was a nice top.  T-shirt material but dressy details,3.0
This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.,3.0
"Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on, but can be worn in a versatile way, and if you are small chested, without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material, i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!",3.0
When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,3.0
"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).
sadly, it's going back.",3.0

"As other reviewers have noted, the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans, but otherwise is unflattering.  also, the color is described as black, but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult, but if able to, i would have returned it.",3.0
"I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.",3.0
"I tried yellow motif, but unfortunately, i did not purchase it.
it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...
i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.

"I'm a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8"" 140#.  overall i sent it back.",3.0
Fair to partly cloudy,3.0
"So this is a gorgeous dress, but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more ""girly"" than ""sleek."" i am short, so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me.",3.0

"ORIGINAL REVIEW (2 STARS): I bought a pack of these because you really can't beat the price. I had been buying Hanes Beefy Tees, but at 9-12 bucks per shirt, I was ready to pinch some pennies. I just needed some cheap tee shirts, and something on the thinner side wouldn't hurt either.These are the thin, lightweight material I was hoping for, and still quite soft. The one I tried on straight from the package fit me nicely, though it was a little longer than I'd like. I expect they'll shrink in the wash, which would be ok as the fit was just slightly loose.However, there was a hole in the front of the shirt! I didn't look at the other 4 from the package, I just packed them up for exchange. Hopefully the second go 'round yields better results. I'll update/add to my review as necessary.UPDATED REVIEW (3 1/2 STARS): The replacement pack of shirts arrived and none of them have holes! They shrunk in the wash a bit, but still fit well enough. Still a good deal if you're just looking for cheap plain tees!",3.0
"I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure, but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft, fine silk, but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap, and, with a fixed thin elastic waistband, was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated, the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type, it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!",3.0
I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.,3.0
"I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic, but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8, to give you an idea. i would recommend it, but it is going back for me.",3.0

 also, this has a side zipper, but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger, this would never work.

Wanted to really like this but it looked way frumpy on my side 4 petite frame. The top area isn’t very flattering and made me look like I have a  super wide torso. This might be due to the fact that the fabric isn’t flowy and sits a bit rigid. Not sure if washing will soften the drape.,3.0

The tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it's not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra doesn't show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.,4.0

"I'm a size xl, so my review might not apply to all people. i purchase my retailer tops in size xl and sometimes they fit great and sometimes they don't. when i put this top on it looked like i was wearing an open cardigan; nowhere near buttoning. i have some sewing experience, so i removed all 4 box pleats which gave me an additional 8 inches of fabric. after doing this i was able to easily button up the blouse and have it lay nicely. but i literally needed that extra 8 inches of fabric in the mid",4.0

"I was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional 40% off, making them a fabulous deal. they are nicely made, and the shade of blue is very pretty. my only complaint, and the reason i'm on the fence is that they are so big. i usually buy a 31 in the ag stevie jeans, occasionally a 32, so i figured i'd be safe sizing down to a 30. wrong. i could have gone to a 29, and possibly even a 28....they're that big! i do like them though, and may just try shrinking them in the dryer.",4.0

"I love simple pull-on jersey dresses and so i had to try this one. unfortunately, it did not work out. fit is tts, i liked the fabric which is soft, silky yet with some weight to it, and i appreciated the thoughtful construction with multiple well placed darts in the chest. the skirt is lovely, swingy but not too full, hangs well. what stopped me from purchasing it is the fit in the shoulders, it was too broad for me and gave the dress an overall awkward shape. the neckline was also a little too",4.0

"First of all, i am only 5'1"", so this adorable tunic does fit me like a dress. i am also pear shaped, and this dress is flattering to my shape. but my biggest issue, it that the dress came in very wrinkled, especially the ruffles.
i took the dress to my retailer store, and they were able to steam some of the wrinkles out, but not all of them. it seems that the fabric used for the ruffles is suppose to be a little crinkly. but it will most likely look worse after you sit. therefore, i am uncertain",4.0

Everything fit well except the top of the waist, which sits at about where my bellybutton is. When sitting, there is not much give to the fabric, so it starts to get uncomfortable pushing into your abdomen. However, when standing, it is a good fit.

I guess I couldn’t have it both ways so I ended up just keeping the small and returning the medium.

I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.,4.0

"The shirt fit great for the first two or three washes. It looks pretty decent too but the polo progressively got tighter and shrunk as the wash cycles happened. The material and comfort reflect the price point of the shirt. I paid about $15 for it and that isn't bad at all for a decent polo shirt. However, for me, since the shirt shrinks after a wash, it was basically $5/wear. That's not particularly worth it, so my advice would be to size up. I would've preferred it to have a little bit more stretch and be made of a slightly more athletic material, but as mentioned, for the price, it's not bad.

I initially ordered the grey in a m per my usual sizing but on trying it on realized that the m was a bit frumpy and there was a lot of additional fabric at the back which tended to wrinkle very easily because it is cotton. i sized down to a s and was much happier with the fit and the overall look of the jacket. but i think this jacket may need some ironing once in a while. the grey color is a darker grey as per the product description and the pictures.,4.0

I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,4.0

I went by the size chart and Amazon's recommendation, but I think I could have gone with the Medium (I'm 5'4"" and 139 lbs). The large is just a tad too roomy.  This may be one of those times when large is too large and medium is just a tiny but too small, but if I order another blazer, I will try the medium next time.Now, the color: I love orange, but I love a soft orange. Not coral, soft orange. There is a difference! I bought another blazer from another company in orange, and it was traffic cone orange -- too bright for me. When I came to this listing, I read a lot of people complaining that their orange blazer was more coral, but I decided to give it a try. Well, mine isn't coral. It is still orange, just not traffic cone orange, or spiced orange, or coral orange. It is not quite as soft as I anticipated, but it is still a softer orange than my original one, so I am keeping it.And finally, about the style: I really like the lapels and the button closure. I also like the pockets, but I tuck my flaps in. The way the pockets are sewn, the seam is finished so the pocket flaps look good tucked in, and it does not show through when you do. Leaving the flaps loose just emphasizes the hip area for me, and looks cleaner to me tucked in. I can also put my hand in the pocket easier if the flaps are tucked.In all, 4/5 stars!",4.0

I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!,4.0

Thank goodness for a nice white basic tee that is not see through! i go back and forth between an xs and s depending on how i want an item to fit - i don't like things to be too form fitting because i still have a little post-baby pooch. i went with a s in this shirt and it works well. my only complaint is that the neckline is not totally straight - where the seam comes up from under the arm to hit the neckline it bumps out a little bit. but it's a great nicer basic that will go well with almost,4.0
"I do like the product but my mom and brother don’t …. First, the jacket has many pockets. Yeah for pocket fans like me… 4 outside,2 zip 2 side pockets and 3 pockets inside the clothes.

Good and bad for me. It gets hot easily . I would imagine if I work out in it it will be an weighted exercise probably.

"I actually like this top, but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than off-the-shoulder. i found it at the store, so i didn't even know it was supposed to be that way. i have the ivory color, and it it does have some tan/beige specks in it, but i don't mind this at all, it adds some texture and warmth. i think it is a great neutral top for work. it has a double layer of fabric, so not sheer at all, and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami.

This is a super cute dress. I wore it to a wedding and got tons of compliments! I ordered a medium. I usually wear S/M in most women's dresses. I do think I could have sized up. I had to pin the chest area though so my bra wasn’t poppin out all night.,4.0
"Really cute top, comfy, with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit, or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact, maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle, but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large, but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.",4.0

Absolutely beautiful & so soft. I was reading other reviews about the quality and its longevity. I just got it so haven’t had that issue yet however the minute I took this sweater out of the package I knew this was delicate and had to be either dry cleaned or washed in a cold delicate cycle. So for now I am saying it is perfect,4.0

"As the sizing indicates these jeans are cut for juniors. If you have hips or a butt, size up. I did and they are still a bit tight across the hips/thighs. Hoping after a few wears they will loosen up. If they do, I will order a second pair because these jeans are just what I was looking for.",4.0

They don't restrict at all (so these aren't for you if you want compression) I got them for post partum comfort and beyond...they make the best shorts for under a dress and often are my go to for sleeping (and I'm a hot sleeper). Only downfall is they slide up through out a wear. They wouldn't be good for working out, but for comfort they are perfect!",4.0
"First off, i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured, textured and substantial.  and for me, the xs fits perfectly, however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2"", 110, 24.5 waist, 32.5 hips, and usually 00p-0p, and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite, this jumps",4.0

"Yeah before I ordered these I read reviews saying go up a size than your normal,nope there definitely regular sizes and fit to match.because once I got them after listening to the reviews they ended up being to big,yay.but they are stretchable so even if they were to small for you it would still stretch to fit more than likely.othe than that they look good 👍",4.0
"This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style, but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up, so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people.",4.0
"I love the lace up design and bought the red xsp, fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality, but over all happy with purchase. wish this top came in navy and white as well. even a navy/white stripe would be a fun option too. thanks you for offering this top in a petite size. :)",4.0

Overall looked pretty good for the price in comparison to everything else out there which is why I gave it a 4. It wouldn’t have been too difficult to tailor to fit a little better. The adjustable waist band on the pants was pretty cool it just took a minute to figure it out. The one problem was the bottom button and hole did not line up which for me was not initially a deal breaker because I could fix it up a bit to at least look good on the outside although the button would need to be moved to the edge of the fabric almost. I eventually decided linen wasn’t the best choice for us and I really don’t need yet another project right now,4.0

"I bought this in the white in both the sp and the mp. i am 5'2"". i ended up keeping the mp (my usually size at 36c, broad shoulders). i found that the top of the sleeves to be a bit snug and i have normal size arms. if you look at the model shots, you can see that they are tight on top. i also found this shirt to be very long, even in the petite sizing. overall, i kept it as it was slimming, quality made, and the tight sleeve hopefully won't bother me (or shrink!)",4.0
"I have bought several of these jackets over the years and they work well in keeping you dry. The water repellency will wear off in 3 or 4 years, depending on usage, which is OK in my opinion.

"These are pretty good high-rise jeans--probably the best you'll find for the price. they're all one color, no whisking or fading, so they look dressier than your average jeans, and the cut through the leg is bone straight, which i think flatters most body shapes. i agree with the other reviewers--they are tight. i got these in a 25, my usual size, and they squeeze my belly. i probably could've sized up, but i'm waiting to see if they stretch out the way most levi's do.",4.0
"Nothing to dislike.  It fits comfortably , not fitted.",4.0
"I like the sweatshirt, but I should have paid more attention the color description ""safety orange"" rather than the pictured color which is darker and a more muted color.

"This dress is so lovely in person, with more muted colors than pictured which will transition nicely into fall.  the overall cut of the dress is really flattering, especially for hourglass/ pear figures.  sadly, i had to return the dress because the arms were insanely small.  i after putting the dress on, i was worried i wouldn't be able to actually get it off.  if you have teeny, tiny arms...you'll probably be okay with your regular size.  if you have any kind of muscle (or squish :)), size up.",4.0
"This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it's semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it's more sheer, it didn't seem as boxy.  i'm tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume.",4.0
The material and fit just wright,4.0
The details on this are beautiful. i love the gold thread and white beads. i thought the medium fit too large and got the small. it seems to fit really well. so you might want to size down one size. the only thing that seems a bit off it the length. it's pretty long.,4.0
"I absolutely loved the print on this shirt, and as soon as i saw in the catalog i knew i had to have it. the velvet is beautiful and the pattern is even more rich in person. unfortunately, the shirt is very thin ? much thinner than i'd expect with velvet ? and is so short that it is more like a crop top. even with the shoulders pulled down for the off the shoulder look, the front of the shirt hit me barely below my navel. for reference, i'm only 5'1. i would buy this over again if it were only l",4.0

Color is beautiful I usually wear a 34 x 32. This one was extremely tight on the legs. I'm no Mr Olympia but dam. But it did make my ass look fat.,4.0
"Exactly as described and light weight, proper sizing and flattering",4.0
Overall great romper! i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did. the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up. the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up.,4.0
"But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier.

Very flattering to a woman's figure. can dress up or down.,4.0
I love thick T-Shirts and this is a thick classy T-Shirt material. Very dressy for business. However its… SEE THROUGH… I only ordered white. Its thick enough that it shouldn’t be see through. To be clear I put both a nude and white bra under it and could see them. I love the shirt just not the part where I need an undershirt thats also a t-Shirt … because you can fully see the cami too.,4.0
"This sweater is very pretty but the material is extremely thin. the blue was ok but the white is nearly see-through. the design is unique but unless it fits really well, the bottom hem where it criss-crosses can bunch out in a weird way. i got my usual s and it was rather loose, causing this to happen. i suggest you size down if you want it to look smooth like it does on the model.",4.0

I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.,4.0

I wouldn’t say the flowered one fit as a “medium” - it wasn’t THAT much smaller - just seemed to cling in places I didn’t want it to whereas the black one didn’t do that.

Jacket was nice quality. But it was NOT bright orange like the photo. It is a burnt orange color.  Not at all what color I expected.  Also I usually fit a women size large.

I love how long they are (however this last purchase the pants were slightly shorter than usual about an inch-I haven't bought any for a few years).  The stretchy fabric is just enough to fit but not be too tight to the legs.  I wash in cold and line dry so that they stay the shape of my body.  Drying shrinks them up again and then they have to stretch out to fit.  They sit right on my hips at the belly button. The only thing I don't like is that I HAVE to wear a belt because they also stretch at the waist and me with a tummy and no waistline there is nothing to hold them up so they are always rolling over or sliding down.

This is a nice cotton sweater. I love cotton. I bought two. The navy blue and then about a week after I bought the oatmeal. Both colors are pretty and on point. The sweaters are boxy which I like for a casual look with high waisted jeans or high waisted joggers.  I’m 57 so no mid drift bearing for me.  I like wearing a white cotton crewneck tee underneath so you can see it under the sweater neckline. I bought the medium for an oversized look. I’m 5’2” and about 117 lbs. A small would have been a perfect fit. Not oversized. I don’t think it would have had a good look with the sweater being boxy. I am happy that I sized up one size. Delivery was on time and the sweater was packaged appropriately. I always love pretty packaging. Something extra like you went to a boutique.

"As long as you’re not a delicate little flower.  Then these are fine shirts. Good thick fabric, 100% cotton (but low thread count feel), will shrink, NOT tagless but tag rips off easily.For this price point, there is no point in complaining as if you paid more so here are some things to expect:It’s 100% cotton so it’s going to shrink since it’s not “pre-shrunk”It’s possible these are “fake” as many claim, or it may be Hanes cutting back on quality control. There is no way to knowing one way or another but here are some observations.Got 3 packs and 1 shirt had a hole in the back already.Shirts will NOT arrive in Factory branded bags, they’ll be in generic sealed plastic bags (my guess is because its easier for “try before you buy returns” to be folded/packaged/resealed for the next buyer) so wash before wearing.This is NOT tagless, but the tag does tear off easily. This doesn’t PROVE these are fake of knock offs (Maybe Hanes has a large stockpile of tags they can sew on for the cost of nothing instead of spending on the special ink, running the machinery and employees trained to operate said machinery to get that tagless. Idk.These are most likely 100% cotton as claimed so they WILL shrink! I find the larger the shirt size the more they will shrink relative to their size. So plan accordingly.A common complaint is that they’re itchy. All I can say is WASH BEFORE WEARING as you should be anyways. Ever heard of demodex mites? Now you have.Another complaint is that they feel rough. this isn’t 3000 thread count Egyptian cotton feeling more like 300 thread count. With that said these are FAR thicker than the genuine Hanes shirts I’ve bought in store in the last few years. Personally, I’ve never noticed.Bottom line: If you are the type of guy who may not even own a pair of cargo pants (anymore) but loved them because of its functionality. Who knows what SAE/metric is, and doesn’t wear tight jeans (by choice).Chances are very high you’ll be happy with these.$2.50/shirt + tax",4.0

"I like this line of Wrangler jeans in the darker blue color. I selected ""Zander"" which was close to the previous Wrangler Extreme Motion jeans I have.The dark (indigo) color and the weave of the jean material I think gives a nice taylored look that is what I like for casual dress look. Nice to wear with a nice shirt and maybe even jacket on top.Also, the stitching is a more muted color that blends in with the fabric as well as the pocket rivets being a more pewter color. More dressy and less work jean look.The previous jeans I bought are Straight Fit Tapered Leg rather than this Athletic Fit Tapered Leg.If you want a bit more room in the thigh get the Straight Fit Tapered Leg.They have a bit more give in that area and the Athletic Fit tends to draw the waist down more for a lower waist fit.",4.0

"I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive when I bought these.I'm generally a jeans guy and have never bought stretch pants of any kind. I also didn't know what to expect from the fabric.POSITIVESI'm 65, and over the years have gained a few inches in the waist.  I was getting tired of cinching down my belt in order to keep my pants up without ""saggy butt syndrome"" or feeling like I was being choked to death at the waist when I sat down.So, ideally I wanted a pant that was lightweight, cool to wear in the heat, with lots of give in the waist, seat & inseam. I also was looking for a pair that did double-duty as a casual, everyday pair that was semi-dressy/business casual.Voila - these pants of hit on all cylinders.  I worked for 30 years in the IT industry where ""business casual"" was the standard dress code. These are an ideal replacement for the traditional ""khakis"".The best part of these, hands down is their COMFORT.  Typically when I was working, the first thing I did when I got home was to get out of my suit or business casual clothes and put on a well-worn pair of jeans.  These are WAY more comfortable than any pair of jeans.No that I'm retired, my typical ""around-the-house"" casual attire is a pair of jeans, pajama bottoms, or lounging pants.These Lees are so comfortable that I could see myself wearing them all day.Fabric - the fabric on these is different than anything I've ever worn.  Heavier than a nylon, lighter than a cotton.  To the touch the fabric has a bit of a velvety feel.NEGATIVESThe only real negative I can think of is that they seem to tend to pick up a little lint.  Not real bad, but just something my wife noticed.Bear in mind that I didn't wash them before I wore them the first time, so after first wash, this may change.The only other thing is that after being a jeans guy my whole life, I think it's going to take me a little time of wearing these before I feel like they will replace my jeans.",4.0

Over all these pjs fit well. The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is because of the boob hole gap between the buttons. Adding another small snap button there would fix it. When washing it does bleed a little. So don’t wash with whites. Other than that I love it,4.0

Back to school purchase for my grandson,4.0
Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.,4.0

The dress is a nice comfortable dress. It keeps cool during heat wave & not clingy because wearer was hot. The dress was not wrinkle when arrived & remained  wrinkle free through out  the day. It’s a good dress with great price!!,4.0
"This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.",4.0

"This dress is lovely. feels like a dream...so comfortable and the lining is silky soft. i feel it runs a little large (as maeve has been this spring/summer) as i ordered a p0 and p2...the p0 fit (i am 5'4"" about 118#.) i ordered the white hoping to take it on a beach vacation. it was just a little too delicate for my needs...i have two younger children. it seemed to be easy to snag or to make a hole in the more delicate woven areas of the dress. otherwise i really liked this dress a lot. too bad",4.0
Not tight and not too baggy. I would’ve liked it just a little bit looser. Very pretty color,4.0

"I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/4 in pants, 34b bust, 5'7""). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais",4.0
Really flattering and fits as expected. Material is a little scratchy but for the price it’s great quality!,4.0
"I received this for christmas this year and have already worn it several days in a row. it is warm enough to wear while walking the dog in the snow and can also be worn to lounge around the house.
the only reason i didn't rate it a 5 is due to the design fact that it doesn't have pockets. i don't love to carry a purse around all of the time so i use my coat pockets a lot. regardless though i would definitely recommend this especially for the price. i was expecting to come here and see this pric",4.0
This dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i don't mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i'm normally a 10/12 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 5'9 height.,4.0

The Desperado color fits smaller than the other 541s that I've ordered before. The waist and thighs are more snug on this one. If they are preshrunk than I guess that would make sense but I don't know if they are or not. The other colors are spot on the way I like them.,4.0

I wanted to love this dress but it was too large... and once i washed it (which is recommended) it shrank so i had to return it.,4.0
"I love wearing this to bed and it's really pretty! the lace is thin and delicate, so it can get snagged easily, but it's pretty comfortable. the only thing that could make it more comfortable is if the material underneath the bust was looser, though it wouldn't be as supportive. overall, i think it's a very beautiful chemise!",4.0

"*updated review after buying a second one* the yellow was a perfect fit but the purple one is too small but they are labeled as the same size. Maybe it’s miss marked . Still a lovely quality sweater, just be mindful!Absolutely lovely! Perfect material; not too thin, not too thick. So soft! Beautiful color too! I’m buying more!",4.0
The material feels nice and i love the flared arms.,4.0
This dress is stunning.  it may be my new favorite thing!  i'm not sure where you are to wear this as it is really fancy but i will wear it to work and church anyways--even if it is a bit on the dressed up side.  the fit it true to size.  i am 5'8 and the length is similar to that on the model in the photo. zipper troubles!  i can zip it off of my body--but when one when it comes to the thicker part where the zipper is i cannot zip it--decided could zip halfway and still shimmy in.,4.0
"I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back.

Arms sleeves is a little baggy. The rest is good.,4.0
Nice but expensive,4.0
"This is a really cute top. yes, it is dry clean only but i plan on hand washing it. one negative is that it is extremely short in length. i'm 5 feet tall and this top barely goes past my bellybutton. it's extremely soft though and definitely different.",4.0
"Purchased this top in medium. i am 5'9"" so normally wear medium. however, could probably have ordered a small. sleeves are very long and it's very full around bottom. love the gold color!",4.0

The legs are very long.,4.0
I absolutely loved the wash and was disappointed when I couldn’t even pull them up to my waist. I am 90% if the time a size 30 in Levi’s. The 30 fit like a 28 maybe even 26. I ordered a 32 and they fit but I kind of wish I would have only sized up one. After wearing them for a few hours they are too big now. I’m hoping they will shrink in the wash because I really want to love this pair. If you have bigger hips and a smaller waist then this fit isn’t really for you.  I’m 5’1” and 145 lbs.,4.0

"Beautiful sweater, unique knit mix and i love the color, but the fabric is too itchy. i was wearing a long sleeve dress underneath but the yarn was prickling my arms, bum and thighs.  colorblock patchwork arrangement made me look extra top hefty and emphasized my trouble spots (upper back/arms).  i ordered lp but it was too large so would recommend staying tts.",4.0

"Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great.",4.0
"The denim is soft and very comfortable, the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size 4 in citizen jeans, and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle.",4.0
"Ended up having to return these. Comfortable and seemed like a decent quality, but they run small. Since they also have no back pockets, and the side pockets are vertical slits, versus a jeans type top slit, they just weren’t right for me.

"I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.",4.0
Accurately sized would be nicer a tad looser But I can’t wait for Fall!,4.0

Love this dress. the fabric is super soft and flowy. be aware that the model is a tall gal.... i'm usually a size 8/10 in dresses and purchased a large. returned it for a large petite as it went way past my knees. looks funny if it is below the knee. the petite is perfect.,4.0

"I loved the multi stripe pattern, buttons, pockets and a-line shape .  i agree it runs small. i sized up from my normal size 4 to size 6.  it sits at my belly button which i like.  i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably.  the pockets kind of sag/pooch forward and don't lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me.  i  straighten the skirt by pulling up.  great buy on sale. i'm 5'2"", 115#.",4.0

"I liked this top a lot when i saw it at the store - the cotton is soft and comfortable, the colors are good (i tried on the white, charcoal, and light aqua blue), and the asymmetrical edge really makes it. the subtle ruffle detail at the edge combined with the pieced asymmetrical hem takes it from a classic tee to a contemporary style. however, my store doesn't have petite sizes, and the regular size hit me at a point in the hip that wasn't super-flattering on me (at 5'1""). it imay be an excelle",4.0

This coat is gorgeous but it runs huge! i am typically a s so that is the size i purchased and it was swimming on me. i sadly had to return for an xs so fingers crossed it fits. the coral color is gorgeous and looks nice with my olive skin. very unique coat and as long as the xs fits i will be one happy lady.,4.0

"This cover up is precious. i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a s/m and m/l. there is not a whole lot of variation between the two. i wear a size 10 pants and the s/m fit, but i may still keep the m/l instead for fear that it may shrink when washed. the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels. that's a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up.",4.0

"I love how unique this vest is. i'm still figuring out how to wear it in a feminine way, as it lacks shape at the waist and the collar sometimes doesn't behave. i think the sweater texture makes it more casual, but i could belt it and wear with fancier shoes to glam it up. it is a nice third piece to keep warm for fall or winter--hopefully i""ll wear it more once i figure it out!",4.0
"So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. 

fit: 5'4"", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee",4.0
I generally like this jacket but there were issues with the lining.  The lining near the armpit of the left shoulder was not entirely sewn as it should have been.

"Amazon, as I order a lot of shirts and sweaters, recommended I order an XL and that it would be a good fit, and while the shirt is slightly stretchy, it still didnt fit completely.

The lengths otherwise are fine, and in my own home at roughly 70-75 degrees (F) after a few moments it becomes fairly warm to wear.",4.0
"Love this dress. in fact, i loved it enough to get it altered so it would fit. purchased the black dress in a size 6, but the top was too big. and i'm not small chested, i am a 32d! i had to get the seam under my underarms taken in for the top of the dress to fit properly. but, now that it is altered...i love it.",4.0

"These are a great dark wash and they fit true to size to every other stevies i own. for reference i am 5'6"", 145lbs, size 6/m and the 29 fit perfect. they are a bit long but i fold them up and it looks just as cute. i highly recommend especially since they are on sale, definitely a closet staple.",4.0

This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.,4.0
"I wanted to love this. the color in the picture is pretty true-to-life. the top fit well, if a bit smaller than usual, but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite (5') frame. it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress. the material is very soft, but thin, and is lined, which was a pleasant surprise. sadly, a return for me.",4.0

"Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11""!).",4.0

"The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me.",4.0

"Cute, easy to wear dress. personally i think it looks better with a belt, or something to accentuate the waist. otherwise it's a lot of fabric in the middle. i didn't think the top was too low as others have mentioned. though, it is possible to wear backwards (with a v neck front) if that bothered you. nice length, long enough for work.",4.0
"This dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots. there wasn't a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store. i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage. although, you probably wouldn't want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough. i would recommend this dress- its gorgeous on. for the price, i think it should come with a slip. fyi, the back half of the waist has elastic,",4.0
"Love everything about this dress except for the elastic waistband. it's a dressier style, and the elastic cheapens the look--definitely needs a ribbon or belt to cover. otherwise the cut and fit is very flattering, the fabric is nice, and the floral pattern is lovely. i found the dress tts (size 4r and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",4.0

I tried this in the store and i liked it. the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality. i like the little subtle dots. i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just don't need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment. but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style.,5.0

I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,5.0
"Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me, that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes, but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it, not because it's see-through at all (it's not), but because of the static. 

also, this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers.",5.0
Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.,5.0

"I have been desperate to find a fabric mosquitos can't bite through until it dawned on me: waterproof. But then finding pants that were ACTUALLY 100% waterproof was a whole other issue. THESE ARE. I've bathed the dogs while wearing them, they are completely waterproof and better than that, THEY'RE MOSQUITO PROOF. I get snacked on like a juice box once it's warm in Texas and typically they only EVER bite my legs (even though I never wear shorts and I'm always in a tank top) and that is where I have a weird horrible allergic reaction to them. Since I got these, I don't go outside without them on and now they're just biting me on the back like cowards (but i don't have an allergic reaction to those so whatever i guess) SO THE PANTS ARE DOING THEIR EXTRA JOB. Zero bites on my legs.As for fit, I got x-small, I'm about 5'4 and weigh 100 pounds and they fit perfect. I probably could have gotten the shorter fit and it would have been fine but I don't mind a little extra length at the bottom, they're not dragging on the ground or swallowing my feet or anything like that. They DON'T have pockets, however there is one small pouch on the inside that you could put something small in like a wallet or money (it wouldn't fit a phone its not that big).They do do the swish swish sound like windbreakers so if you're looking for quiet pants, these aren't them, but otherwise, they ARE waterproof and they are mosquito proof, and they're comfortable and light enough to wear in texas heat without feeling like theres a swamp in my pants.",5.0

This came unfortunately after my son's homecoming which is so sad he has since worn it to a basketball game because he loves it so much I'm glad he loves it and hope he wears it more but I'm also sad that the company did not get it delivered on the time frame they stated because I ended up having to buy another suit for and of course he doesn't want to return it,5.0

"I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant ""i'm buyi",5.0

I was going to order a size 2 online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size 2 but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a 2 probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir,5.0

the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.

"This sweater is perfect for cool days.  the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite).  i actually liked the length so did not order petite.  the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend.  it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse.  the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it doesn't open in front, which is a plus.  the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue.  the red is beautiful and as pictured.",5.0

I was tempted to get this online but just wasn't sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didn't know how this would look with leggings or jeans. i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute! there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you can't really see in the online pics that i love. it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots. i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw,5.0

"My sales assistant/style consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on, and how they fit, and she brought this dress in, with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on. i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug, highlight every bump, and i could not have been more wrong! this dress is wonderful on! it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet. you must try this on to see how flattering it is. i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel.",5.0
"This dress fit me very well; I am 5’4”, 160 lbs, with a pear-shaped, mature body.  Since I buy sheath dresses with my hips in mind, I was concerned that this garment would not fit my bustline properly. It did!  This is probably due to the princess seams down the front. It fits well through the shoulders, and although the underarms are cut lower than expected, they did not gap or reveal my bra. The material is quality,  it is nicely lined, and has a stylish kick pleat in the back.  The back zipper is hidden discretely in the back seam. My only complaint is that the hem is below my knees; this will need to be altered by a seamstress. I paired the dress with a sparkly hip-length formal jacket, and also a more casual blouson top, and both combinations “worked”. I think I will wear this often!",5.0

I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.,5.0

"This top is true to size for me, i'm 5'8'' 128lbs, and i ordered both a size 4 and 6. the six was too big, i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldn't lift my arms, the shoulder seem hung too low. the 4 was perfect, i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt. i always order a small or size 4 in tops. the bigger size didn't add any length in front just added a boxier feel",5.0

"Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,",5.0
"This is so comfortable and so flattering. i got it in two colors. i think it runs tts. i sized up so i could wear it lower on my hips. i'm 5'2"" and got the regular size rather than petite and it's more of a maxi skirt on me--way longer than on the model. this is what i wanted (i can never find maxi skirts that aren't way too long even when i try petite), but if you want it more midi, go for petite sizing.",5.0

So we purchased XL his true to size the second time around and they fit him perfectly. They are relaxed roomy fit NOT a fitted fit.,5.0

"I absolutely love this dress! i purchased it in my usual size 2 petite and it looks as though it was made for me. the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering. the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem; in addition, the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit. despite these issues, i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k",5.0

"I like the fit. They are nice and roomy on me for freedom of movement. These are practical rain pants. I haven't used them in rain yet, but am sure they will be fine. I've been using a Columbia rain jacket for a couple years now and it's a great, versatile, waterproof piece, so I'm sure these pants will be the same. I love that these also have the mesh lining for air flow and so you are not touching the waterproof coating of the shell fabric, which in my experience can irritate my skin, even through clothing. I'm glad I finally bought these nice rain pants and am sure they will come in handy for a long time, even as nice lightweight snow pants worn over warm leggings.",5.0

"I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it's comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer.",5.0
Fits good a little long but they will shrink,5.0
"I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it. i am 5'11"" so love the longer length. the large was too wide so got the medium. the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up. i think i will get the white too!",5.0
"The skirt material is super comfortable. hte cut is also pretty flattering, i don't hink this picture does the skirt justice. the regualr size was a little long on me, i would order a petite (if like me, you are 5'1.5""#, went xs #at 115 lbs). the skirt is also a bit stretchy, not stiff.

color is way prettier in person, i never looked twice at th skirt online, but in the store, it looked myuch prettier.",5.0
"I love these. the white actually has a more pronounced look between the top and bottom with a little but of shading. since they look a bit different because of that i got both white and black. perfect wait and not to giant, and perfect for year round work. the shawl color is a tad flimsy in how it sits but overall these are fabulous.",5.0

"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd",5.0
Picked this up at the store in my usual size small. it fit perfectly. i am a 34d and the buttons closed with no gap. the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim. so comfy. my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sa's wanted to buy one. loved the color too~very versatile.,5.0
"I had my eye on this piece since it came out, but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending... but it finally went on sale. alas, all the petite sizes are gone, but i decided to order the regular xs anyway. (the length quote is long, but i figured maybe with heels?). then the xxs became available and i snatched that too...so glad. the xxs fits better and isn't as long (i have to wear heels, don't get me wrong, but the xs was still long with heels). it is soft and lovely, the xxs linin",5.0
Everything looks good but the bow tie never came and I am hoping there’s a way to get one sent out asap before New Years.,5.0
"I’m loving my new cardi! I ordered in a size medium for a more fitted look (I had even planned on NOT buttoning up just so I could have a more fitted look). I normally wear a size large. Even though I sized down it fit perfectly! I could even button it up without having gaps in the chest area. I am a 36DD for reference and 145 pounds and 5’5"" tall. I am also short waisted. I plan on buying different colors now because I love the fit!! Happy Customer! :-)",5.0
"I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.",5.0

"This is my first pair of pilcro pants but defiantly not my last. i always have a hard time trying to decide between a regular length and a tall because at 5'10"" i usually fall somewhere in between. i ordered the regular length and couldn't b happier, they are just long enough to wear a shorter heal with or a pair of flats. the beige color is really nice and pairs nicely with the sky blue mock turtleneck sweater i also ordered from retailer. i love the retro 70's style too! i couldn't be happier wi",5.0

I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made.

"I absolutely love these shorts. i ordered a medium. i was nervous they would be too small, (my legs aren't the skinniest), but because of the slit on the side, they were fine. i do have a pretty tiny waist, and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back. i am almost 5'7' and weight 145. i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it. i love the material as well, they are extremely comfortable. a little pricey, but i will definitely make use of them. i love the pr",5.0
"I liked this bc it is long, ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.",5.0
Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.,5.0
I have purchased this before.  Still like and hope to repurchase after the ones I own are worn out.  5 stars.,5.0
I purchased my normal size medium and I think could have even gotten away with a small. Something I like about this top is the elastic on the shoulders is not too tight. I’ve had issues with clothing before where it’s squeezing on my body and it’s not flattering. Can wear off shoulder as well but I prefer it on.,5.0
This shirt was very cute. i ordered it as something to be able to wear to class with leggings and it is perfect. the colors are great and the length is very nice. it will be a nice piece to layer with a jacket for the the fall.,5.0

"I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h",5.0

"I put off ordering these for MONTHS because of the brand. Lee doesn’t make cool clothes or nice pants for work. Well I’m stupid and have since ordered more in other colors. High quality, comfortable, and very flattering. I ordered a 4 regular and I actually had extra length in the inseam where I could wear a kitten heel. I have a 32” inseam.",5.0
I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!,5.0
This is a great sweater for the price. It's true to size and the fit is flattering. It isn't the softest sweater which surprised me since it's 100% cotton but holds up well when you wash it.Would recommend.,5.0
Just a little more softer.  Very stiff even after a few washes.  Lol,5.0

i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself, and when i was walking it rode up (it's like a stretchy mesh type material). but i'm carrying a few more pounds than i'd like right now. once i lo",5.0
"I bought a second one already and looking forward to getting another one in case I can’t find later😂 that is how in love with it I am! First for the “champagne” that looks more like a pinky white.. but I loved the fit, fabric is fine.. I love that the shorts are not uncomfortably “showy” and still feels sexy. Also got the black one, fabric feels a bit thicker than the “champagne” one but still a dream. Love them both. Highly recommend!

"I did not intend on buying this dress, as i had taken two others that i had seen on-line into the dressing room. i actually saw the black version of this dress first, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't available in my size. so, i thought i would try this on just for size. i was totally shocked as to how cute it looked on! i had taken both the xs and the s into the dressing room. the xs was very tight fitting in the arms and chest. i am very small busted, and normally wear a xs in tops and",5.0

"When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress ""paeonia dress"", and i paired it with the ""rosebud layered necklace"". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6"", 127 and even thoug",5.0

"This was the first time I've ever ordered clothing from online, let alone a suit jacket. Dimensions matched US spec measurements, so knowing your chest size/sleeve length is critically important to get a good fit. If in doubt, best to order one size larger than you normally get as it's easier to tailor down than up. Just note, that if you do need to tailor up, there are no additional cloth to do so.The feel of the fabric, thickness of the material and look of the fabric is indistinguishable from the $300 suit that I was comparing it next to.  There are pockets, but are gently stitched together which you can easily cut away with a small scissor.Overall, it's a good black tone and is very formal. Finding accompanying black pants were easy to find as well.",5.0

It's a nice shirt, great material, and looks sharp with the french cuff and some decent links. The sleeves come out of my jacket just right and show off my links perfectly. It's a very comfortable material that is nice and cool. A suggestion to keep cool in any dress shirt - buy a moisture wicking undershirt!

"Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose, these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .",5.0

"Alright, so I usually don't write reviews, which is ironically what every scam reviewer writes haha!Anyhow, I saw the reviews here, and honestly I can't entirely speak of the sturdiness yet. I have bought three pairs of these jeans in 28x30.So far so good, I have recently started buying deadstock and vintage LEVIS 501 from pre-2000, which are much better quality than new LEVIS, unfortunately, both in fit and quality. In quality level I'll compare NEW-LEVIS, OG-LEVIS and the Wranglers bought here.1: QualityOG LEVIS, wins hands down, the quality of material and stitching is just streets ahead.However insofar as NEW-501 vs Wrangler  Authentic 5-pocket- Wrangler wins, as much as I like 501s, their quality ranges widely depending on production year and colour. Generally blue 501 have a good quality, but their other colours often come out stiff, for comparison I bought the Khaki in LEVIS 501, I believe they were called timberwolf colour, but the same as Khaki here. Incredibly stiff in the material, even after several washes. Whereas the Wrangler has been nice and soft even after a couple of test-washes!2: Sizing & FitOG Levis and the Wranglers here are quite similar in fit on the hip and in inseam. I usually use 30 inseam, but that often comes out too short on many pants, however vintage pants and jeans with inseam 30 fit me like a glove. With these wranglers out of the three pairs of jeans, the inseam has remained the same.New LEVIS terrible inseam, too short compared to description, I know that it is the fashion currently to have a pants-leg that is at ankle/above ankle length, which is fine, but unfortunately sellers sell with the inseam being 30, when in fact it is only 29 or so.NEW LEVIS have terrible fit on the hip as well, it is slightly below mid-rise I'd argue, and perhaps some of them barely above low-rise, so much inconsistency with the 501 currently.OG LEVIS, nice solid mid-rise waist-line, and I can say the same for these Wranglers.Insofar as the hip is concerned, a bit tight, same with OG LEVIS and NEW LEVIS; which I don't mind, this is the standard fit, not the relaxed or flex version.For all of the jeans. The thigh and calf fit is also nice and roomy if you buy in your size; I certainly don't have skinny legs, relatively muscular throughout and they are not too tight, a little strain on the thigh perhaps, and on the peak of the calf, but not uncomfortable.What started my jeans journey was actually waist/leg fit, rather than quality. I went to a local store and tried a pair of jeans on in 28x30, and I couldn't get them over my calf, and the tightness in the thigh was ridiculous not to mention how low they sat on my waist. When I checked the fit it wrote ""Standard"" after that it was a long journey to find that Wranglers are generally consistent and high quality especially considering the price.Wrangler used to have this 5-pocket as made in USA, I was lucky enough to buy a pair a couple of years ago, and unsurprisingly the material is nicer than what we currently have as well as construction of stitching, with that said this current version, imo has a better hip/waist fit, if just barely.I'll probably buy another 1-2 pairs of these at some point",5.0
Very comfortable & I love the high waistband. They are EXTREMELY short though. I wear them as swim shorts & they are perfect!,5.0
Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim. i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs. if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts. i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material it's made of. it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline. the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid.,5.0
"This is an adorable dress - I love the off the shoulder look. I originally ordered this in a medium, but sent it back and ordered the small, which fit better. The bust is very stretchy and the bottom is loose, so if you have a bigger bust you don't need to size up. Love the blue color and the material is nicer than I thought it would be.

This top has glam written all over it. the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling. it lays so beautiful...i would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look. because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse. no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you. i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable.,5.0

This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat,5.0

"I bought 3 of these shirts in Dusk Blue, Dusty Green, and White.  I'm 6'0"" tall with a 44"" chest, 17"" biceps, and a 34"" waist.  I weigh about 207 lbs and have a muscular build with fairly low body fat.  I wasn't looking for a skin tight muscle shirt or compression shirt.  I just wanted a clean fitting t-shirt for summer that I can wear under a linen button up shirt without a bunch of baggy fabric at the waist.The reviews regarding size are all over the place.  I'll give you my take on sizing and fit along with overall construction and quality.  Spoiler alert, the sizing is a perfectly normal US standard.  A L is a L and an XL is an XL.So, most reviews stated that these shirts run small and recommend sizing up 1 or even 2 sizes.  I ordinarily take that with a grain of salt because most US guys are shopping a ""slim fit"" shirt like this despite the fact they are sporting 30% body fat and most of that sits around their waist.  People are delusional.But there were so many reviews recommending sizing up, I took the bait and ordered the 3 shirts in XL.  As I feared, the XL fit way too large.  The chest was not bad but not the snug fit I wanted.  The neck was OK.  And the sleeves were OK.  But the length was way too long.  And there was way too much extra fabric around the waist.  They looked sloppy on me.Guys, just because you're 6'0"" tall and 207 lbs like me does NOT mean we are built the same.  I can only surmise that a lot of guys leaving these reviews have no upper body muscle mass or leg development and carry a lot of their weight around their belly.  The classic pear shape of a sunken chest, and spare tire, and chicken legs says you should be shopping foe a ""classic fit"" t-shirt, not a slim fit shirt with spandex.I sent the XL shirts back and ordered the same 3 colors in my usual size L.  The fit of the size L is perfect.  The neck is a high V.  The sleeves are snug against my biceps.  The chest is snug but not muscle shirt tight.  And there is enough of a taper towards the waist to keep it looking fitted and clean but again, not like a muscle shirt.  It looks casual and well fitted without being too baggy or so tight that it shows off everything under it.As for the fabric, I got what I expected.  I have some white dress t-shirts that are 95% cotton and 5% spandex and I figured these would be similar.  They are.  Adding spandex to cotton makes it stretchy but it also makes it weirdly smooth and adds a little bit of shine.  It ends up looking and feeling a little like polyester more than cotton. So if you expected that typical Hanes white t-shirt look with a matte finish, you may be disappointed.  On the other hand, the spandex keeps about 90% of the wrinkles out of the cotton shirt and makes it really comfortable to wear.  Again, the no wrinkle look is a little like polyester but is keeps looking sharp all day.As for construction, the neck is really well stitched.  Same with the sleeves and the waist.  The label is printed which I prefer rather than a tag.  Overall, this is the clean, slim fit look I was hoping for.In summary, this is a nice, slim fit shirt well suited for casual wear alone or under a long sleeve button up shirt worn unbuttoned in hot weather.  If you are muscular with low body fat just order your normal size.  If you are a typical US male with no muscle and a big belly, yeah, order up a size or two.  Or maybe look at some t-shirts that are ""classic fit"" without spandex to avoid drawing attention to your waistline.Hope this helps.",5.0

"I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.",5.0

"These are absolutely the softest and most comfortable sweaters I own!  They are perfect for casual or professional, and a simple layering tee or cami underneath gives a nice cozy feeling all day.  The material is SO soft, and it's stretchy to where it doesn't cling to you or hang un an unflattering way.  I am typically a mix between medium and large and it does run the tiniest bit large, so a medium fit me perfectly.  I now own about 6 of them!",5.0
Another perfect maxi from retailer! the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my normal size in maxis (medium) and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight. i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i don't feel like i am showing too much cleavage. it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect.,5.0
"I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.",5.0
"I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.",5.0

"I'm a 60ish guy, and let's just say that I no longer wear the 32"" waist jeans I wore in my 20s.I've always been a fan of Lee jeans vs. Levi or Wrangler, for the simple reason that Lee jeans always fit me better than the others.But as my waist and butt have expanded over the years, I found that it was difficult to find jeans that didn't cut me in half at the waist when I bent over, making me feel like I couldn't breathe.But recently I discovered these.  Wow, what a difference!!  These without question, hands down are the best fitting jeans I've ever worn!  The comfort and fit is second to none.They have a lot of stretch in the waist, legs, knees, & inseam, making kneeling, squatting, sitting, & crouching so much easier.If you are looking for COMFORT & FIT, look no further, just buy these. You won't be sorry.",5.0

Usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find. this is more red in person that in the photo. great feel to material and the drape is wonderful. sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am (5'6 and 138 lbs) but this one has a nice slimming effect and the v-neck is complimentary to a smaller bust 36b. love it !!!!!!!,5.0

"Read all the reviews to figure out what size to get my tall, skinny son for prom. He is 6'2"" and around 170 lbs. We ended up purchasing a size 44 based off of other reviews. The jacket fit great! Pants looked great on, but he definitely needed a belt. He said the suit was really comfortable to dance in and he is wild on the dance floor. The large tag on the sleeve was obnoxious, but my husband was able to very carefully remove it. The purple suit fit his fun, goofy personality perfectly. He really looked sharp in it and he got a TONS of compliments from everyone at prom. The price of $60 was great and it was way cheaper than renting a tux.  The quality is way better than I expected for the price.He will definitely be wearing this again!",5.0
"If you're looking for a high quality shirt you might want to look elsewhere as this isn't it.  However, if you're just looking for a nice shirt that isn't going to set you back $70+ then I say give these a try.  I bought a couple of these shirts (different colors/patterns) and I've enjoyed them so far.  I wear them to the office from time to time and they look nice.  The material is a bit thin so longevity is still in question.",5.0

I'm a pretty big skeptical on buying clothes online. I ready so many reviews on this dress before I bought it. I decided to go for it cause I needed something for a graduation. I am 5'5 and approx 215 lbs(if that hemps anyone pick a size).  This dress fit perfect with an xl.  I am super shocked. I might actually buy another one in a different pattern! The material is soft AND the biggest bonus is that it has pockets!!!,5.0

I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.,5.0
This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater,5.0

Very comfortable and flattering at same time. Flows over your body and doesn’t cling. Soft knit material and lovely dark mauve like color. I liked so much that I ordered a red one.

It is a becoming length, the short sleeves offer more modesty for church-going or business, the color was great and easy to accessorize, and it is most comfortable.

Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.,5.0
"Too often have I purchased an apparel item on Amazon only to receive something with a really strange fit or made of a material whose texture or drape I just can’t work with. It’s with that in mind that I offer this glowing review for these mock wrap v-neck dresses. In fact, I liked my first so much I went back and ordered the same dress in two more prints!The material is flowy and not too sheer - it’s breathable enough for a humid Florida afternoon, and can be dressed up or down depending on your choice of accessories and footwear. The colors in the prints are bold and hold up well to washing.Did I mention these have POCKETS? I love me a dress with pockets.Finally, the spaghetti straps are adjustable. If you’re less-than-endowed up top as I am, this dress still accentuates what it should without leaving you exposed. That’s a big win!",5.0

This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.,5.0

I really like the 502 jeans just know that you may need to order a few pairs to get the right fit.  They come with some significant variations depending on origin and even within the same origin sizes can still vary.  I had variations of over an inch in difference from 1 pair to the next.  It took 3 different orders but found 3 pairs of different color 502's that I  love.  Would highly recommend them.  I hope they hold up and will provide updates if they fail to meet expectations.,5.0

And that would require some weight loss.Also, the red is an unattractive muddy red, the gray is soft and flattering.",5.0

I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.,5.0

it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t",5.0

"This is a perfect jacket style. I have had a medium blue and an olive green version of this style for a couple years, and I found them to be very practical  and I started thinking that I need a medium brown or tan color of this style jacket.

We bought black, so I can't speak to the transparency of white pants- but based on the thickness of these pants, that seems unlikely.
